Monsieur Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us here.` The commissary left the room. Stonor crossed to Jack and wrung him by the hand. Poirot had risen, and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks that struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. The magistrate was reading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging desperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back. Suddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in. `Monsieur le juge! Monsieur le juge!` `But yes. What is it?` `The dagger! It is gone!` `What—gone?` `Vanished. Disappeared. The glass jar that contained it is empty!` `What?` I cried. `Impossible. Why, only this morning I saw—` The words died on my tongue. But the attention of the entire room was diverted to me. `What is that you say?` cried the commissary. `This morning?` `I saw it there this morning,` I said slowly. `About an hour and a half ago, to be accurate.` `You went to the shed, then? How did you get the key?` `I asked the sergent de ville for it.` `And you went there? Why?` I hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to make a clean breast of it. `Monsieur Hautet,` I said, `I have committed a grave	fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.` `Proceed, monsieur.` `The fact of the matter is,` I said, wishing myself anywhere else but where I was, `that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and I—well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.` `Ah!` cried the magistrate indignantly. `But it is a grave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is altogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this folly.` `I know,` I said meekly. `Nothing that you can say could be too severe, monsieur.` `You did not invite this lady to come here?` `Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.` `Well, well,` said the magistrate, softening. `It was most irregular, but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful. What it is to be young!` And he sighed sentimentally. But the commissary, less romantic and more practical, took up the tale: `But did you not reclose and lock the door when you departed?` `That`s just it,` I said slowly. `That`s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to the town. In the excitement I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the villa.` `Then for twenty minutes at least—` said he slowly. He stopped, [missing]. `Exactly,` I said. `Twenty minutes,` mused the commissary. `It is deplorable,` said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. `Without precedent.` Suddenly another voice spoke. `You find it deplorable?` asked Giraud. `Certainly I do.` `I find it admirable!` said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. `Admirable, Monsieur Giraud?` asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. `Precisely.` `And why?` `Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.` There was a note of menace in his voice. He continued: `He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that fingerprints might be discovered on it.` Poirot turned to Bex. `You said there were none?` Giraud shrugged his shoulders. `Perhaps he could not be sure.` Poirot looked at him. `You are wrong, Monsieur Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.` `I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.` The magistrate`s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M. Hautet addressed us: `Our work here is finished. Perhaps, Monsieur Renauld, you will listen while your evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my methods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality. The case is now in the clever hands of the renowned Monsieur Giraud.` `He will without doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heartfelt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.` And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his and observed the time. `Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,` he said. `And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.` We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot`s voice arrested me: `One little moment, my friend.` Dexterously he whipped out his yard measure and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall, from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket and followed me out into the open air.    "}]}

Renauld quarrels with his son over latter`s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris.\" I don`t see anything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of the quarrel.` `We agree, mon ami at least as to the cause. But what exact motive underlay this procedure of Monsieur Renauld`s?` I opened my eyes in surprise. `Anger against his son of course.` `Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?` `So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.` `Well, let us pass from that.` `Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the event of the morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?` `I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was dispatched. Masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings.` `I do not see that you can fix that definitely unless you question Mademoiselle Daubreuil again.` `There is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see nothing, Hastings?` I looked at him for a moment. `Of course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was after the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended danger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being in the other`s pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.` A faint smile crossed Poirot`s lips. `You do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used, later in her story? If the mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it, and—what is more—send his son there?` `It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation later. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious lady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was indeed Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise all along maintained.` Poirot shook his head. `My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the fragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack`s unknown correspondent, and that it was she who came to the Villa Genevieve that night. Whether she intended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father, we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is what occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed letters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque.` `This she indignantly tore up. The terms of her letter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably deeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and here the words that he used are significant.` `\"Yes, yes, but for God`s sake go now\",` I repeated. `They seem to me a little vehement, perhaps, that is all.` `That is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why? Not because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that was slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.` `Why should it be?` I asked, bewildered. `That is what we ask ourselves. Why should it be? But later we have the incident of the wristwatch—which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual drama. It is half past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the evidence of the wristwatch we know that the crime was committed, or at any rate that it was staged, before twelve o`clock. We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced. By the doctor`s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours—with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more. Now, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I place the death as having occurred on the morning of 7th June.` I stared at him, stupefied. `But how? Why? How can you possibly know?` `Because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically explained. Mon ami, I have taken you step by step along the way. Do you not now see what is so glaringly plain?` `My dear Poirot, I can`t see anything glaring about it. I did think I was beginning to see my way before, but I`m now hopelessly fogged. For goodness` sake, get on, and tell me who killed Mr. Renauld.` `That is just what I am not sure of as yet.` `But you said it was glaringly clear?` `We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is crimes we are investigating—for which as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There there, ne vous [unreadable]. I will explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three points at which Monsieur Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action—three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of 7th June. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No 2 is indirectly connected with her, since it concerns a marriage between Monsieur Renauld`s son and her daughter. But the cause of No 3 is hidden from me [unclear]. We had to deduce it. Now, mon ami, let me ask you a question: whom do we believe to have planned this crime?` `Georges Conneau,` I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot [missing]. 	`Exactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save herself, the man she loves, and her child. Since we are satisfied that it was Georges Conneau who died [missing] lie to her, and as Georges Conneau is no [missing] it follows that the third case is out of court.` `[Missing]. Equally so. So we are forced to the second—that Mrs. Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved—or to [missing] words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree?` `Yes,` I admitted. `It seems logical enough.` `Then Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, "}]}

It seems an absolute miracle. We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Genevieve—and yet she is there before us!` `Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way while we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she \"put it over\" on Hercule Poirot!` `But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.` `Eh bien, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.` `Madame Daubreuil?` `Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike. Even I did not suspect—triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me—that she would not try to gain admission to the villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.` `And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?` `Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have been suicide, mon ami. On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil`s body, I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform first—then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle. By the morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared and the syringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld`s hand. What would he say, the excellent Monsieur Hautet? \"Poor woman! What did I tell you? The shock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! Did I not say that I should not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most tragic case, the Renauld Case!\"` `However, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had planned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her. There is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There is a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil. The idea of suicide is at an end, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make a getaway with her little silk ladder while we are still battering on the inside of the farther door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite before we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her. But she was checkmated, not by Hercule Poirot, but by la petite acrobate with her wrists of steel.` I mused over the whole story. `When did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she told us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?` Poirot smiled. `My friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first day? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me if I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had seen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of Marthe Daubreuil from the beginning. The girl with the anxious eyes. Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld`s behalf, for she did not know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.` `By the way,` I exclaimed, `how is Jack Renauld?` `Much better. He is still at the Villa Marguerite. But Madame Daubreuil has disappeared. The police are looking for her.` `Was she in with her daughter, do you think?` `We shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I doubt very much if the police will ever find her.` `Has Jack Renauld been—told?` `Not yet.` `It will be a terrible shock to him.` `Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duven as a siren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth. Marthe Daubreuil was very beautiful. She set herself to fascinate Jack, and she succeeded, but remember his curious reluctance to break with the other girl. And see how he was willing to go to the guillotine rather than implicate her. I have a little idea that when he learns the truth, he will be horrified—revolted, and his false love will wither away.` `What about Giraud?` `He has a case of the nerves, that one! He has been obliged to return to Paris.` We both smiled. Poirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor pronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot who broke it to him. The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother`s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father`s past. `To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.` With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice. A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot. `Reassure yourself, Monsieur Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.` There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled. Shortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a foxhound adorning Poirot`s mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring glance, Poirot nodded. `Mais oui. I got my five hundred francs! Is he not a splendid fellow? I call him Giraud!` A few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression on his face. `Monsieur Poirot, I`ve come to say goodbye. I`m sailing for South America almost immediately. My father had large interests over the continent, and I mean to start a new life out there.` `You go alone, Monsieur Jack?` `My mother comes with me—and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary. He likes out-of-the-way parts of the world.` `No one else goes with you?` Jack flushed. `You mean?` `A girl who loves you very dearly—who has been willing to lay down her life for you.` `How could I ask her?` muttered the boy. `After all that has happened, could I go to her and— Oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?` `Les femmes—they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.` `Yes, but— I`ve been such a damned fool.` `So have all of us, one time and another,` observed Poirot philosophically. But Jack`s face had hardened. `There`s something else. I`m my father`s son. Would anyone marry me, knowing that?` `You are your father`s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity—` `Well, then—` `Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice—` The boy looked up. His eyes softened. `My mother!` `Yes. You are your mother`s son as well as your father`s. Then go to Mademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back—and see what she will say!` Jack looked irresolute. `Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man—a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life. Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting. You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.` And what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages? There is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Genevieve. `I can`t call you Bella,` I said, `since it isn`t your name. And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar. So it`s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married the Prince, you remember. I`m not a Prince, but—` She interrupted me. `Cinderella warned him I`m sure. You see, she couldn`t promise to turn into a princess. She was only a little scullion after all—` `It`s the Prince`s turn to interrupt,` I interpolated. `Do you know what he said?` `No?` `\"Hell!\" said the Prince—and kissed her.` And I suited the action to the word.

Monsieur Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us here.` The commissary left the room. Stonor crossed to Jack and wrung him by the hand. Poirot had risen, and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks that struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. The magistrate was reading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging desperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back. Suddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in. `Monsieur le juge! Monsieur le juge!` `But yes. What is it?` `The dagger! It is gone!` `What—gone?` `Vanished. Disappeared. The glass jar that contained it is empty!` `What?` I cried. `Impossible. Why, only this morning I saw—` The words died on my tongue. But the attention of the entire room was diverted to me. `What is that you say?` cried the commissary. `This morning?` `I saw it there this morning,` I said slowly. `About an hour and a half ago, to be accurate.` `You went to the shed, then? How did you get the key?` `I asked the sergent de ville for it.` `And you went there? Why?` I hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to make a clean breast of it. `Monsieur Hautet,` I said, `I have committed a grave	fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.` `Proceed, monsieur.` `The fact of the matter is,` I said, wishing myself anywhere else but where I was, `that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and I—well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.` `Ah!` cried the magistrate indignantly. `But it is a grave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is altogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this folly.` `I know,` I said meekly. `Nothing that you can say could be too severe, monsieur.` `You did not invite this lady to come here?` `Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.` `Well, well,` said the magistrate, softening. `It was most irregular, but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful. What it is to be young!` And he sighed sentimentally. But the commissary, less romantic and more practical, took up the tale: `But did you not reclose and lock the door when you departed?` `That`s just it,` I said slowly. `That`s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to the town. In the excitement I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the villa.` `Then for twenty minutes at least—` said he slowly. He stopped, [missing]. `Exactly,` I said. `Twenty minutes,` mused the commissary. `It is deplorable,` said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. `Without precedent.` Suddenly another voice spoke. `You find it deplorable?` asked Giraud. `Certainly I do.` `I find it admirable!` said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. `Admirable, Monsieur Giraud?` asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. `Precisely.` `And why?` `Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.` There was a note of menace in his voice. He continued: `He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that fingerprints might be discovered on it.` Poirot turned to Bex. `You said there were none?` Giraud shrugged his shoulders. `Perhaps he could not be sure.` Poirot looked at him. `You are wrong, Monsieur Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.` `I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.` The magistrate`s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M. Hautet addressed us: `Our work here is finished. Perhaps, Monsieur Renauld, you will listen while your evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my methods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality. The case is now in the clever hands of the renowned Monsieur Giraud.` `He will without doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heartfelt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.` And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his and observed the time. `Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,` he said. `And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.` We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot`s voice arrested me: `One little moment, my friend.` Dexterously he whipped out his yard measure and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall, from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket and followed me out into the open air.    "}]}

You forget the letter.` `No, I do not forget. But what makes you think that letter was written to Monsieur Renauld?` `Why, it was found in his pocket, and—and—` `And that is all!` cut in Poirot. `There was no mention of any name to show to whom the letter was addressed. We assumed it was to the dead man because it was in the pocket of his overcoat. Now, mon ami, something about that overcoat struck me as unusual. I measured it and made the remark that he wore his overcoat very long. That remark should have given you to think.` `I thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something,` I confessed. `Ah, quelle idée! Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of Monsieur Jack Renauld. Eh bien, Monsieur Jack Renauld wears his overcoat [garbled] short. Put those two facts together with a thirds namely, that Monsieur Jack Renauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris, and tell me what you make of it!` `I see,` I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot`s remarks bore in upon me. `That letter was written to Jack Renauld—not to his father. He caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.` Poirot nodded. `Precisement! We can return to this point later. For the moment let us content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do with Monsieur Renauld pere, and pass to the next chronological event.` `\"23rd May.\"` I read: `\"M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter`s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris.\" I don`t see anything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of the quarrel.` `We agree, mon ami at least as to the cause. But what exact motive underlay this procedure of Monsieur Renauld`s?` I opened my eyes in surprise. `Anger against his son of course.` `Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?` `So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.` `Well, let us pass from that.` `Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the event of the morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?` `I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was dispatched. Masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings.` `I do not see that you can fix that definitely unless you question Mademoiselle Daubreuil again.` `There is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see nothing, Hastings?` I looked at him for a moment. `Of course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was after the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended danger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being in the other`s pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.` A faint smile crossed Poirot`s lips. `You do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used, later in her story? If the mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it, and—what is more—send his son there?` `It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation later. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious lady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was indeed Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise all along maintained.` Poirot shook his head. `My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the fragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack`s unknown correspondent, and that it was she who came to the Villa Genevieve that night. Whether she intended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father, we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is what occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed letters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque.` `This she indignantly tore up. The terms of her letter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably deeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and here the words that he used are significant.` `\"Yes, yes, but for God`s sake go now\",` I repeated. `They seem to me a little vehement, perhaps, that is all.` `That is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why? Not because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that was slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.` `Why should it be?` I asked, bewildered. `That is what we ask ourselves. Why should it be? But later we have the incident of the wristwatch—which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual drama. It is half past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the evidence of the wristwatch we know that the crime was committed, or at any rate that it was staged, before twelve o`clock. We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced. By the doctor`s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours—with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more. Now, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I place the death as having occurred on the morning of 7th June.` I stared at him, stupefied. `But how? Why? How can you possibly know?` `Because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically explained. Mon ami, I have taken you step by step along the way. Do you not now see what is so glaringly plain?` `My dear Poirot, I can`t see anything glaring about it. I did think I was beginning to see my way before, but I`m now hopelessly fogged. For goodness` sake, get on, and tell me who killed Mr. Renauld.` `That is just what I am not sure of as yet.` `But you said it was glaringly clear?` `We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is crimes we are investigating—for which as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There there, ne vous [unreadable]. I will explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three points at which Monsieur Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action—three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of 7th June. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No 2 is indirectly connected with her, since it concerns a marriage between Monsieur Renauld`s son and her daughter. But the cause of No 3 is hidden from me [unclear]. We had to deduce it. Now, mon ami, let me ask you a question: whom do we believe to have planned this crime?` `Georges Conneau,` I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot [missing]. 	`Exactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save herself, the man she loves, and her child. Since we are satisfied that it was Georges Conneau who died [missing] lie to her, and as Georges Conneau is no [missing] it follows that the third case is out of court.` `[Missing]. Equally so. So we are forced to the second—that Mrs. Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved—or to [missing] words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree?` `Yes,` I admitted. `It seems logical enough.` `Then Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, "}]}

It seems an absolute miracle. We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Genevieve—and yet she is there before us!` `Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way while we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she \"put it over\" on Hercule Poirot!` `But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.` `Eh bien, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.` `Madame Daubreuil?` `Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike. Even I did not suspect—triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me—that she would not try to gain admission to the villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.` `And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?` `Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have been suicide, mon ami. On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil`s body, I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform first—then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle. By the morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared and the syringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld`s hand. What would he say, the excellent Monsieur Hautet? \"Poor woman! What did I tell you? The shock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! Did I not say that I should not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most tragic case, the Renauld Case!\"` `However, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had planned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her. There is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There is a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil. The idea of suicide is at an end, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make a getaway with her little silk ladder while we are still battering on the inside of the farther door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite before we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her. But she was checkmated, not by Hercule Poirot, but by la petite acrobate with her wrists of steel.` I mused over the whole story. `When did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she told us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?` Poirot smiled. `My friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first day? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me if I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had seen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of Marthe Daubreuil from the beginning. The girl with the anxious eyes. Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld`s behalf, for she did not know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.` `By the way,` I exclaimed, `how is Jack Renauld?` `Much better. He is still at the Villa Marguerite. But Madame Daubreuil has disappeared. The police are looking for her.` `Was she in with her daughter, do you think?` `We shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I doubt very much if the police will ever find her.` `Has Jack Renauld been—told?` `Not yet.` `It will be a terrible shock to him.` `Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duven as a siren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth. Marthe Daubreuil was very beautiful. She set herself to fascinate Jack, and she succeeded, but remember his curious reluctance to break with the other girl. And see how he was willing to go to the guillotine rather than implicate her. I have a little idea that when he learns the truth, he will be horrified—revolted, and his false love will wither away.` `What about Giraud?` `He has a case of the nerves, that one! He has been obliged to return to Paris.` We both smiled. Poirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor pronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot who broke it to him. The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother`s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father`s past. `To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.` With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice. A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot. `Reassure yourself, Monsieur Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.` There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled. Shortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a foxhound adorning Poirot`s mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring glance, Poirot nodded. `Mais oui. I got my five hundred francs! Is he not a splendid fellow? I call him Giraud!` A few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression on his face. `Monsieur Poirot, I`ve come to say goodbye. I`m sailing for South America almost immediately. My father had large interests over the continent, and I mean to start a new life out there.` `You go alone, Monsieur Jack?` `My mother comes with me—and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary. He likes out-of-the-way parts of the world.` `No one else goes with you?` Jack flushed. `You mean?` `A girl who loves you very dearly—who has been willing to lay down her life for you.` `How could I ask her?` muttered the boy. `After all that has happened, could I go to her and— Oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?` `Les femmes—they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.` `Yes, but— I`ve been such a damned fool.` `So have all of us, one time and another,` observed Poirot philosophically. But Jack`s face had hardened. `There`s something else. I`m my father`s son. Would anyone marry me, knowing that?` `You are your father`s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity—` `Well, then—` `Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice—` The boy looked up. His eyes softened. `My mother!` `Yes. You are your mother`s son as well as your father`s. Then go to Mademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back—and see what she will say!` Jack looked irresolute. `Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man—a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life. Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting. You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.` And what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages? There is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Genevieve. `I can`t call you Bella,` I said, `since it isn`t your name. And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar. So it`s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married the Prince, you remember. I`m not a Prince, but—` She interrupted me. `Cinderella warned him I`m sure. You see, she couldn`t promise to turn into a princess. She was only a little scullion after all—` `It`s the Prince`s turn to interrupt,` I interpolated. `Do you know what he said?` `No?` `\"Hell!\" said the Prince—and kissed her.` And I suited the action to the word.
