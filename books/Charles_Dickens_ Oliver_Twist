{"text":"\nOLIVER TWIST or THE PARISH BOY`S PROGRESS\n\nby Charles Dickens\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE\nCIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH\n\nAmong other public buildings in a certain town, which for many\nreasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to\nwhich I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently\ncommon to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and\nin this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not\ntrouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible\nconsequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all\nevents; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head\nof this chapter.\n\nFor a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow\nand trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of\nconsiderable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any\nname at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that\nthese memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that\nbeing comprised within a couple of pages, they would have\npossessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and\nfaithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any\nage or country.\n\nAlthough I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a\nworkhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable\ncircumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to\nsay that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for\nOliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred.  The fact\nis, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to\ntake upon himself the office of respiration,--a troublesome\npractice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy\nexistence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock\nmattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the\nnext: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.  Now,\nif, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by\ncareful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and\ndoctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and\nindubitably have been killed in no time.  There being nobody by,\nhowever, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by\nan unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such\nmatters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point\nbetween them.  The result was, that, after a few struggles,\nOliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the\ninmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been\nimposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could\nreasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been\npossessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much\nlonger space of time than three minutes and a quarter.\n"}

{"text":"\n\nAs Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of\nhis lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over\nthe iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was\nraised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly\narticulated the words, `Let me see the child, and die.`\n\nThe surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the\nfire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub\nalternately.  As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to\nthe bed`s head, said, with more kindness than might have been\nexpected of him:\n\n`Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.`\n\n`Lor bless her dear heart, no!` interposed the nurse, hastily\ndepositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of\nwhich she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.\n\n`Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have,\nsir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on `em dead\nexcept two, and them in the wurkus with me, she`ll know better\nthan to take on in that way, bless her dear heart!  Think what it\nis to be a mother, there`s a dear young lamb do.`\n\nApparently this consolatory perspective of a mother`s prospects\nfailed in producing its due effect.  The patient shook her head,\nand stretched out her hand towards the child.\n\nThe surgeon deposited it in her arms.  She imprinted her cold\nwhite lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over\nher face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back--and died.\nThey chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had\nstopped forever.  They talked of hope and comfort. They had been\nstrangers too long.\n\n`It`s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!` said the surgeon at last.\n\n`Ah, poor dear, so it is!` said the nurse, picking up the cork of\nthe green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she\nstooped to take up the child.  `Poor dear!`\n\n`You needn`t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,`\nsaid the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation.\n`It`s very likely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel\nif it is.`  He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on\nhis way to the door, added, `She was a good-looking girl, too;\nwhere did she come from?`\n"}

{"text":"\n`She was brought here last night,` replied the old woman, `by the\noverseer`s order.  She was found lying in the street.  She had\nwalked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but\nwhere she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.`\n\nThe surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.  `The\nold story,` he said, shaking his head: `no wedding-ring, I see.\nAh!  Good-night!`\n\nThe medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse,\nhaving once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on\na low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.\n\nWhat an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver\nTwist was!  Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his\nonly covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a\nbeggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to\nhave assigned him his proper station in society.  But now that he\nwas enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in\nthe same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his\nplace at once--a parish child--the orphan of a workhouse--the\nhumble, half-starved drudge--to be cuffed and buffeted through\nthe world--despised by all, and pitied by none.\n\nOliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an\norphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and\noverseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER II\n\nTREATS OF OLIVER TWIST`S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD\n\nFor the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a\nsystematic course of treachery and deception.  He was brought up\nby hand.  The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan\nwas duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish\nauthorities.  The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the\nworkhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled\nin `the house` who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist,\nthe consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need.  The\nworkhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not.\nUpon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely\nresolved, that Oliver should be `farmed,` or, in other words,\nthat he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three\nmiles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders\nagainst the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without\nthe inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under\nthe parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received\nthe culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny\nper small head per week.  Sevenpence-halfpenny`s worth per week\nis a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for\nsevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and\nmake it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom\nand experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had\na very accurate perception of what was good for herself.  So, she\nappropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own\nuse, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a\nshorter allowance than was originally provided for them.  Thereby\nfinding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a\nvery great experimental philosopher.\n\nEverybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who\nhad a great theory about a horse being able to live without\neating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own\nhorse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have\nrendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at\nall, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to\nhave had his first comfortable bait of air.  Unfortunately for,\nthe experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care\nOliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually\nattended the operation of _her_ system; for at the very moment when\nthe child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible\nportion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in\neight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from\nwant and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got\nhalf-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the\nmiserable little being was usually summoned into another world,\nand there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.\n"}

{"text":"\nOccasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting\ninquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up\na bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened\nto be a washing--though the latter accident was very scarce,\nanything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the\nfarm--the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome\nquestions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their\nsignatures to a remonstrance.  But these impertinences were\nspeedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the\ntestimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the\nbody and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed),\nand the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish\nwanted; which was very self-devotional.  Besides, the board made\nperiodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle\nthe day before, to say they were going.  The children were neat\nand clean to behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the\npeople have!\n\nIt cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce\nany very extraordinary or luxuriant crop.  Oliver Twist`s ninth\nbirthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in\nstature, and decidedly small in circumference.  But nature or\ninheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver`s\nbreast.  It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare\ndiet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may\nbe attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all.  Be this as\nit may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it\nin the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young\ngentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound\nthrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be\nhungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was\nunexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the\nbeadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.\n\n`Goodness gracious!  Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?` said Mrs.\nMann, thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected\necstasies of joy.  `(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats\nupstairs, and wash `em directly.)--My heart alive!  Mr. Bumble,\nhow glad I am to see you, sure-ly!`\n\nNow, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of\nresponding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit,\nhe gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed\nupon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a\nbeadle`s.\n"}

Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr.\nBumble, do, sir.`\n\nAlthough this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that\nmight have softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means\nmollified the beadle.\n\n`Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,`\ninquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, `to keep the parish\nofficers a waiting at your garden-gate, when they come here upon\nporochial business with the porochial orphans?

He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other.\nHe relaxed.\n\n`Well, well, Mrs. Mann,` he replied in a calmer tone; `it may be\nas you say; it may be.  Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on\nbusiness, and have something to say.`\n\nMrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick\nfloor; placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his\ncocked hat and cane on the table before him.  Mr. Bumble wiped\nfrom his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered,\nglanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled.  Yes, he\nsmiled.

Nor a drop,` said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand\nin a dignified, but placid manner.\n\n`I think you will,` said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of\nthe refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it.  `Just a\nleetle drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.`\n\nMr. Bumble coughed.\n\n`Now, just a leetle drop,` said Mrs. Mann persuasively.\n\n`What is it?` inquired the beadle.\n\n`Why, it`s what I`m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to\nput into the blessed infants` Daffy, when they ain`t well, Mr.\nBumble,` replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and\ntook down a bottle and glass.  `It`s gin.

{"text":"\n`Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,` said Mrs. Mann.\n\nOliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the\nchair, and the cocked hat on the table.\n\n`Will you go along with me, Oliver?` said Mr. Bumble, in a\nmajestic voice.\n\nOliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with\ngreat readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs.\nMann, who had got behind the beadle`s chair, and was shaking her\nfist at him with a furious countenance.  He took the hint at\nonce, for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not\nto be deeply impressed upon his recollection.\n\n`Will she go with me?` inquired poor Oliver.\n\n`No, she can`t,` replied Mr. Bumble.  `But she`ll come and see\nyou sometimes.`\n\nThis was no very great consolation to the child.  Young as he\nwas, however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling\ngreat regret at going away.  It was no very difficult matter for\nthe boy to call tears into his eyes.  Hunger and recent ill-usage\nare great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very\nnaturally indeed.  Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces, and\nwhat Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and\nbutter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the\nworkhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little\nbrown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by\nMr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had\nnever lighted the gloom of his infant years.  And yet he burst\ninto an agony of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after\nhim.  Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was\nleaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and\na sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the\nchild`s heart for the first time.\n\nMr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly\ngrasping his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at\nthe end of every quarter of a mile whether they were `nearly\nthere.` To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief\nand snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which\ngin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated;\nand he was once again a beadle.\n"}

{"text":"\nOliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter\nof an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second\nslice of bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the\ncare of an old woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board\nnight, informed him that the board had said he was to appear\nbefore it forthwith.\n\nNot having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board\nwas, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was\nnot quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.  He had no\ntime to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him\na tap on the head, with his cane, to wake him up: and another on\nthe back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow,\nconducted him into a large white-washed room, where eight or ten\nfat gentlemen were sitting round a table.  At the top of the\ntable, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a\nparticularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face.\n\n`Bow to the board,` said Bumble.  Oliver brushed away two or\nthree tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board\nbut the table, fortunately bowed to that.\n\n`What`s your name, boy?` said the gentleman in the high chair.\n\nOliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which\nmade him tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind,\nwhich made him cry.  These two causes made him answer in a very\nlow and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white\nwaistcoat said he was a fool.  Which was a capital way of raising\nhis spirits, and putting him quite at his ease.\n\n`Boy,` said the gentleman in the high chair, `listen to me. You\nknow you`re an orphan, I suppose?`\n\n`What`s that, sir?` inquired poor Oliver.\n\n`The boy _is_ a fool--I thought he was,` said the gentleman in the\nwhite waistcoat.\n\n`Hush!` said the gentleman who had spoken first.  `You know\nyou`ve got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by\nthe parish, don`t you?`\n\n`Yes, sir,` replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.\n"}

The gentleman who spoke last was\nunconsciously right.  It would have been very like a Christian,\nand a marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for\nthe people who fed and took care of _him_. But he hadn`t, because\nnobody had taught him.\n\n`Well!  You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful\ntrade,` said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.\n\n`So you`ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o`clock,`\nadded the surly one in the white waistcoat.\n\nFor the combination of both these blessings in the one simple\nprocess of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of\nthe beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on\na rough, hard bed, he sobbed himself to sleep.  What a novel\nillustration of the tender laws of England!  They let the paupers\ngo to sleep!\n\nPoor Oliver!  He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy\nunconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very\nday arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material\ninfluence over all his future fortunes.  But they had.  And this\nwas it:\n\nThe members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical\nmen; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse,\nthey found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have\ndiscovered--the poor people liked it!  It was a regular place of\npublic entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there\nwas nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper\nall the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all\nplay and no work.  `Oho!` said the board, looking very knowing;\n`we are the fellows to set this to rights; we`ll stop it all, in\nno time.`  So, they established the rule, that all poor people\nshould have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not\nthey), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by\na quick one out of it.  With this view, they contracted with the\nwater-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a\ncorn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal;\nand issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a\nweek, and half a roll of Sundays.  They made a great many other\nwise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies,\nwhich it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce\npoor married people, in consequence of the great expense of a\nsuit in Doctors` Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to\nsupport his family, as they had theretofore done, took his family\naway from him, and made him a bachelor!  There is no saying how\nmany applicants for relief, under these last two heads, might\nhave started up in all classes of society, if it had not been\ncoupled with the workhouse; but the board were long-headed men,\nand had provided for this difficulty.  The relief was inseparable\nfrom the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people.\n"}

{"text":"\nFor the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the\nsystem was in full operation.  It was rather expensive at first,\nin consequence of the increase in the undertaker`s bill, and the\nnecessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which\nfluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a week\nor two`s gruel.  But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as\nwell as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies.\n\nThe room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with\na copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an\napron for the purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled\nthe gruel at mealtimes.  Of this festive composition each boy had\none porringer, and no more--except on occasions of great public\nrejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides.\n\nThe bowls never wanted washing.  The boys polished them with\ntheir spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed\nthis operation (which never took very long, the spoons being\nnearly as large as the bowls), they would sit staring at the\ncopper, with such eager eyes, as if they could have devoured the\nvery bricks of which it was composed; employing themselves,\nmeanwhile, in sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the\nview of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have\nbeen cast thereon.  Boys have generally excellent appetites.\nOliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow\nstarvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and\nwild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and\nhadn`t been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a\nsmall cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he\nhad another basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some\nnight happen to eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to\nbe a weakly youth of tender age.  He had a wild, hungry eye; and\nthey implicitly believed him. A council was held; lots were cast\nwho should walk up to the master after supper that evening, and\nask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist.\n\nThe evening arrived; the boys took their places.  The master, in\nhis cook`s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper\nassistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served\nout; and a long grace was said over the short commons.  The gruel\ndisappeared; the boys whispered each other, and winked at Oliver;\nwhile his next neighbors nudged him.  Child as he was, he was\ndesperate with hunger, and reckless with misery.  He rose from\nthe table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand,\nsaid: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:\n"}

Do I understand that he asked for more,\nafter he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?`\n\n`He did, sir,` replied Bumble.\n\n`That boy will be hung,` said the gentleman in the white\nwaistcoat.  `I know that boy will be hung.`\n\nNobody controverted the prophetic gentleman`s opinion.  An\nanimated discussion took place.  Oliver was ordered into instant\nconfinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of\nthe gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would\ntake Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish.  In other words,\nfive pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who\nwanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling.\n\n`I never was more convinced of anything in my life,` said the\ngentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and\nread the bill next morning: `I never was more convinced of\nanything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be\nhung.`\n\nAs I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated\ngentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of\nthis narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I\nventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had\nthis violent termination or no.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER III\n\nRELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH\nWOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE\n\nFor a week after the commission of the impious and profane\noffence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in\nthe dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the\nwisdom and mercy of the board.  It appears, at first sight not\nunreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming\nfeeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the\nwhite waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual`s\nprophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his\npocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself\nto the other.  To the performance of this feat, however, there\nwas one obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs being\ndecided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and\nages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of\nthe board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced\nunder their hands and seals.  There was a still greater obstacle\nin Oliver`s youth and childishness.  He only cried bitterly all\nday; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little\nhands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in\nthe corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start\nand tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall,\nas if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the\ngloom and loneliness which surrounded him.\n\nLet it not be supposed by the enemies of `the system,` that,\nduring the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was\ndenied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the\nadvantages of religious consolation.  As for exercise, it was\nnice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions\nevery morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of\nMr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a\ntingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications\nof the cane.  As for society, he was carried every other day into\nthe hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a\npublic warning and example.  And so for from being denied the\nadvantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same\napartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to\nlisten to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of\nthe boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by\nauthority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good,\nvirtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the\nsins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly\nset forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of\nthe powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the\nmanufactory of the very Devil himself.\n"}

{"text":"\nIt chanced one morning, while Oliver`s affairs were in this\nauspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield,\nchimney-sweep, went his way down the High Street, deeply\ncogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain\narrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather\npressing.  Mr. Gamfield`s most sanguine estimate of his finances\ncould not raise them within full five pounds of the desired\namount; and, in a species of arthimetical desperation, he was\nalternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing\nthe workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate.\n\n`Wo--o!` said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.\n\nThe donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering,\nprobably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a\ncabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of\nsoot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing\nthe word of command, he jogged onward.\n\nMr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey\ngenerally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running after\nhim, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevitably have\nbeaten in any skull but a donkey`s.  Then, catching hold of the\nbridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle reminder\nthat he was not his own master; and by these means turned him\nround.  He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun\nhim till he came back again.  Having completed these\narrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.\n\nThe gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate\nwith his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some\nprofound sentiments in the board-room.  Having witnessed the\nlittle dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled\njoyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he saw at\nonce that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver\nTwist wanted.  Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he perused the\ndocument; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing\nfor; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr.\nGamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well\nknew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for\nregister stoves.  So, he spelt the bill through again, from\nbeginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of\nhumility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\n\n`This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to `prentis,` said Mr.\nGamfield.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Ay, my man,` said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a\ncondescending smile.  `What of him?`\n\n`If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in\na good `spectable chimbley-sweepin` bisness,` said Mr. Gamfield,\n`I wants a `prentis, and I am ready to take him.`\n\n`Walk in,` said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  Mr.\nGamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow\non the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to\nrun away in his absence, followed the gentleman with the white\nwaistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him.\n\n`It`s a nasty trade,` said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again\nstated his wish.\n\n`Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,` said\nanother gentleman.\n\n`That`s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the\nchimbley to make `em come down again,` said Gamfield; `that`s all\nsmoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain`t o` no use at all in\nmaking a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and\nthat`s wot he likes.  Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy,\nGen`l`men, and there`s nothink like a good hot blaze to make `em\ncome down vith a run.  It`s humane too, gen`l`men, acause, even\nif they`ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes `em\nstruggle to hextricate theirselves.`\n\nThe gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by\nthis explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look\nfrom Mr. Limbkins.  The board then proceeded to converse among\nthemselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the\nwords `saving of expenditure,` `looked well in the accounts,`\n`have a printed report published,` were alone audible.  These\nonly chanced to be heard, indeed, or account of their being very\nfrequently repeated with great emphasis.\n\nAt length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board,\nhaving resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins\nsaid:\n\n`We have considered your proposition, and we don`t approve of\nit.`\n\n`Not at all,` said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Decidedly not,` added the other members.\n\nAs Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation\nof having bruised three or four boys to death already, it\noccurred to him that the board had, perhaps, in some\nunaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this\nextraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings. It\nwas very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they\nhad; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the\nrumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from\nthe table.\n\n`So you won`t let me have him, gen`l`men?` said Mr. Gamfield,\npausing near the door.\n\n`No,` replied Mr. Limbkins; `at least, as it`s a nasty business,\nwe think you ought to take something less than the premium we\noffered.`\n\nMr. Gamfield`s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he\nreturned to the table, and said,\n\n`What`ll you give, gen`l`men?  Come!  Don`t be too hard on a poor\nman.  What`ll you give?`\n\n`I should say, three pound ten was plenty,` said Mr. Limbkins.\n\n`Ten shillings too much,` said the gentleman in the white\nwaistcoat.\n\n`Come!` said Gamfield; `say four pound, gen`l`men.  Say four\npound, and you`ve got rid of him for good and all.  There!`\n\n`Three pound ten,` repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.\n\n`Come!

He`s just the boy for you.  He wants\nthe stick, now and then: it`ll do him good; and his board\nneedn`t come very expensive, for he hasn`t been overfed since he\nwas born.  Ha!  ha!  ha!`\n\nMr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and,\nobserving a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile\nhimself.  The bargain was made.  Mr. Bumble, was at once\ninstructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were to be\nconveyed before the magistrate, for signature and approval, that\nvery afternoon.\n"}

{"text":"\nIn pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his\nexcessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to\nput himself into a clean shirt.  He had hardly achieved this very\nunusual gymnastic performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with\nhis own hands, a basin of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two\nounces and a quarter of bread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver\nbegan to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the\nboard must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose,\nor they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way.\n\n`Don`t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be\nthankful,` said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity.\n`You`re a going to be made a `prentice of, Oliver.`\n\n`A prentice, sir!` said the child, trembling.\n\n`Yes, Oliver,` said Mr. Bumble.  `The kind and blessed gentleman\nwhich is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of\nyour own: are a going to `prentice` you: and to set you up in\nlife, and make a man of you: although the expense to the parish\nis three pound ten!--three pound ten, Oliver!--seventy\nshillins--one hundred and forty sixpences!--and all for a naughty\norphan which nobody can`t love.`\n\nAs Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this\naddress in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child`s\nface, and he sobbed bitterly.\n\n`Come,` said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was\ngratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence\nhad produced; `Come, Oliver!  Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of\nyour jacket, and don`t cry into your gruel; that`s a very foolish\naction, Oliver.`  It certainly was, for there was quite enough\nwater in it already.\n\nOn their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that\nall he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say,\nwhen the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that\nhe should like it very much indeed; both of which injunctions\nOliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a\ngentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no\ntelling what would be done to him. When they arrived at the\noffice, he was shut up in a little room by himself, and\nadmonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to\nfetch him.\n"}

It was a large room,\nwith a great window.  Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with\npowdered heads: one of whom was reading the newspaper; while the\nother was perusing, with the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell\nspectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before him.  Mr.\nLimbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr.\nGamfield, with a partially washed face, on the other; while two\nor three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were lounging about.\n\nThe old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over\nthe little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after\nOliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.\n\n`This is the boy, your worship,` said Mr. Bumble.\n\nThe old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head\nfor a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve;\nwhereupon, the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.\n\n`Oh, is this the boy?` said the old gentleman.\n\n`This is him, sir,` replied Mr. Bumble.  `Bow to the magistrate,\nmy dear.`\n\nOliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance.  He had been\nwondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates` powder,\nwhether all boards were born with that white stuff on their\nheads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account.\n\n`Well,` said the old gentleman, `I suppose he`s fond of\nchimney-sweeping?`\n\n`He doats on it, your worship,` replied Bumble; giving Oliver a\nsly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn`t.\n\n`And he _will_ be a sweep, will he?` inquired the old gentleman.\n\n`If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he`d run\naway simultaneous, your worship,` replied Bumble.\n\n`And this man that`s to be his master--you, sir--you`ll treat him\nwell, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?`\nsaid the old gentleman.\n\n`When I says I will, I means I will,` replied Mr. Gamfield\ndoggedly.\n"}

But the magistrate was half blind and half\nchildish, so he couldn`t reasonably be expected to discern what\nother people did.\n\n`I hope I am, sir,` said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.\n\n`I have no doubt you are, my friend,` replied the old gentleman:\nfixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about\nhim for the inkstand.\n\nIt was the critical moment of Oliver`s fate.

But, as it chanced to be\nimmediately under his nose, it followed, as a matter of course,\nthat he looked all over his desk for it, without finding it; and\nhappening in the course of his search to look straight before\nhim, his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver\nTwist: who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of\nBumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future\nmaster, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too\npalpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.\n\nThe old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from\nOliver to Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a\ncheerful and unconcerned aspect.\n\n`My boy!` said the old gentleman, `you look pale and alarmed.\nWhat is the matter?`\n\n`Stand a little away from him, Beadle,` said the other\nmagistrate: laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an\nexpression of interest.  `Now, boy, tell us what`s the matter:\ndon`t be afraid.`\n\nOliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed\nthat they would order him back to the dark room--that they would\nstarve him--beat him--kill him if they pleased--rather than send\nhim away with that dreadful man.\n\n`Well!` said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most\nimpressive solemnity.  `Well! of all the artful and designing\norphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most\nbare-facedest.`\n"}

The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary\nan example, took counsel together on the expediency of shipping\noff Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel bound to a good\nunhealthy port.  This suggested itself as the very best thing\nthat could possibly be done with him: the probability being, that\nthe skipper would flog him to death, in a playful mood, some day\nafter dinner, or would knock his brains out with an iron bar;\nboth pastimes being, as is pretty generally known, very favourite\nand common recreations among gentleman of that class.  The more\nthe case presented itself to the board, in this point of view,\nthe more manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they\ncame to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver\neffectually, was to send him to sea without delay.\n\nMr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary\ninquiries, with the view of finding out some captain or other who\nwanted a cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the\nworkhouse to communicate the result of his mission; when he\nencountered at the gate, no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry,\nthe parochial undertaker.\n\nMr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a\nsuit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the\nsame colour, and shoes to answer.  His features were not\nnaturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but he was in\ngeneral rather given to professional jocosity.  His step was\nelastic, and his face betokened inward pleasantry, as he advanced\nto Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by the hand.\n\n`I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night,\nMr. Bumble,` said the undertaker.\n\n`You`ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,` said the beadle, as\nhe thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box\nof the undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a\npatent coffin.  `I say you`ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,`\nrepeated Mr. Bumble, tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a\nfriendly manner, with his cane.\n\n`Think so?` said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and\nhalf disputed the probability of the event.  `The prices allowed\nby the board are very small, Mr. Bumble.`\n\n`So are the coffins,` replied the beadle: with precisely as near\nan approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.\n\nMr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought\nto be; and laughed a long time without cessation.  `Well, well,\nMr. Bumble,` he said at length, `there`s no denying that, since\nthe new system of feeding has come in, the coffins are something\nnarrower and more shallow than they used to be; but we must have\nsome profit, Mr. Bumble.

The people who have been better off, and have paid\nrates for many years, are the first to sink when they come into\nthe house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three or four\ninches over one`s calculation makes a great hole in one`s\nprofits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.`\n\nAs Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an\nill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to\nconvey a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter\ngentleman thought it advisable to change the subject.

Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for\nfive minutes; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him\nthat evening `upon liking`--a phrase which means, in the case of\na parish apprentice, that if the master find, upon a short trial,\nthat he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much\nfood into him, he shall have him for a term of years, to do what\nhe likes with.\n\nWhen little Oliver was taken before `the gentlemen` that evening;\nand informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad\nto a coffin-maker`s; and that if he complained of his situation,\nor ever came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea,\nthere to be drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might\nbe, he evinced so little emotion, that they by common consent\npronounced him a hardened young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to\nremove him forthwith.\n\nNow, although it was very natural that the board, of all people\nin the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous\nastonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling\non the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular\ninstance.  The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of\npossessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was\nin a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal\nstupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received.  He\nheard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and,\nhaving had his luggage put into his hand--which was not very\ndifficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the\nlimits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three\ninches deep--he pulled his cap over his eyes; and once more\nattaching himself to Mr. Bumble`s coat cuff, was led away by that\ndignitary to a new scene of suffering.\n\nFor some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or\nremark; for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle\nalways should: and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was\ncompletely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble`s coat as they\nblew open, and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat\nand drab plush knee-breeches.  As they drew near to their\ndestination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look\ndown, and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by\nhis new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and\nbecoming air of gracious patronage.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Oliver!`  said Mr. Bumble.\n\n`Yes, sir,` replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.\n\n`Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.`\n\nAlthough Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the\nback of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a\ntear in them when he looked up at his conductor.  As Mr. Bumble\ngazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed\nby another, and another.  The child made a strong effort, but it\nwas an unsuccessful one.  Withdrawing his other hand from Mr.\nBumble`s he covered his face with both; and wept until the tears\nsprung out from between his chin and bony fingers.\n\n`Well!` exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his\nlittle charge a look of intense malignity.  `Well!  Of _all_ the\nungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver,\nyou are the--`\n\n`No, no, sir,` sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the\nwell-known cane; `no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed,\nindeed I will, sir!  I am a very little boy, sir; and it is\nso--so--`\n\n`So what?` inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.\n\n`So lonely, sir!  So very lonely!` cried the child.  `Everybody\nhates me.  Oh! sir, don`t, don`t pray be cross to me!`  The child\nbeat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion`s face,\nwith tears of real agony.\n\nMr. Bumble regarded Oliver`s piteous and helpless look, with some\nastonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a\nhusky manner; and after muttering something about `that\ntroublesome cough,` bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy.\nThen once more taking his hand, he walked on with him in silence.\n\nThe undertaker, who had just putup the shutters of his shop, was\nmaking some entries in his day-book by the light of a most\nappropriate dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.\n\n`Aha!` said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing\nin the middle of a word; `is that you, Bumble?`\n\n`No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,` replied the beadle.  `Here! I`ve\nbrought the boy.`  Oliver made a bow.\n"}

But he`ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry--he`ll\ngrow.`\n\n`Ah!  I dare say he will,` replied the lady pettishly, `on our\nvictuals and our drink.  I see no saving in parish children, not\nI; for they always cost more to keep, than they`re worth.\nHowever, men always think they know best. There!  Get downstairs,\nlittle bag o` bones.`  With this, the undertaker`s wife opened a\nside door, and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a\nstone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante-room to the\ncoal-cellar, and denominated `kitchen`; wherein sat a slatternly\ngirl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much\nout of repair.\n\n`Here, Charlotte,` said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver\ndown, `give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for\nTrip.  He hasn`t come home since the morning, so he may go\nwithout `em.  I dare say the boy isn`t too dainty to eat `em--are\nyou, boy?`\n\nOliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who\nwas trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the\nnegative; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before\nhim.\n\nI wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to\ngall within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could\nhave seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the\ndog had neglected.  I wish he could have witnessed the horrible\navidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the\nferocity of famine.  There is only one thing I should like\nbetter; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same\nsort of meal himself, with the same relish.\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER V\n\nOLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES.  GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE\nFIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER`S\nBUSINESS\n\nOliver, being left to himself in the undertaker`s shop, set the\nlamp down on a workman`s bench, and gazed timidly about him with\na feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older\nthan he will be at no loss to understand.  An unfinished coffin\non black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked\nso gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him, every\ntime his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object:\nfrom which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly\nrear its head, to drive him mad with terror.  Against the wall\nwere ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in\nthe same shape: looking in the dim light, like high-shouldered\nghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.\nCoffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of\nblack cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the\ncounter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes\nin very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a\nhearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance.\nThe shop was close and hot.  The atmosphere seemed tainted with\nthe smell of coffins.  The recess beneath the counter in which\nhis flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave.\n\nNor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver.\nHe was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and\ndesolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation.\nThe boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him.  The\nregret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence\nof no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.\n\nBut his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he\ncrept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he\ncould be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard\nground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the\nsound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep.\n\nOliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the\noutside of the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his\nclothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about\ntwenty-five times.  When he began to undo the chain, the legs\ndesisted, and a voice began.\n\n`Open the door, will yer?` cried the voice which belonged to the\nlegs which had kicked at the door.\n\n`I will, directly, sir,` replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and\nturning the key.\n\n`I suppose yer the new boy, ain`t yer?` said the voice through\nthe key-hole.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Yes, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\n`How old are yer?` inquired the voice.\n\n`Ten, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\n`Then I`ll whop yer when I get in,` said the voice; `you just see\nif I don`t, that`s all, my work`us brat!` and having made this\nobliging promise, the voice began to whistle.\n\nOliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the\nvery expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to\nentertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever\nhe might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew\nback the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door.\n\nFor a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the\nstreet, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the\nunknown, who had addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a\nfew paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big\ncharity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a\nslice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of\nhis mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great\ndexterity.\n\n`I beg your pardon, sir,` said Oliver at length: seeing that no\nother visitor made his appearance; `did you knock?`\n\n`I kicked,` replied the charity-boy.\n\n`Did you want a coffin, sir?` inquired Oliver, innocently.\n\nAt this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that\nOliver would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his\nsuperiors in that way.\n\n`Yer don`t know who I am, I suppose, Work`us?` said the\ncharity-boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the\npost, meanwhile, with edifying gravity.\n\n`No, sir,` rejoined Oliver.\n"}

{"text":"\n`I`m Mister Noah Claypole,` said the charity-boy, `and you`re\nunder me.  Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!` With\nthis, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the\nshop with a dignified air, which did him great credit.  It is\ndifficult for a large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make\nand heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances;\nbut it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal\nattractions are a red nose and yellow smalls.\n\nOliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of\nglass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the\nfirst one to a small court at the side of the house in which they\nwere kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who\nhaving consoled him with the assurance that `he`d catch it,`\ncondescended to help him.  Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after.\nShortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared.  Oliver having\n`caught it,` in fulfilment of Noah`s prediction, followed that\nyoung gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.\n\n`Come near the fire, Noah,` said Charlotte.  `I saved a nice\nlittle bit of bacon for you from master`s breakfast.  Oliver,\nshut that door at Mister Noah`s back, and take them bits that\nI`ve put out on the cover of the bread-pan.  There`s your tea;\ntake it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for\nthey`ll want you to mind the shop.  D`ye hear?`\n\n`D`ye hear, Work`us?` said Noah Claypole.\n\n`Lor, Noah!` said Charlotte, `what a rum creature you are!  Why\ndon`t you let the boy alone?`\n\n`Let him alone!` said Noah.  `Why everybody lets him alone\nenough, for the matter of that.  Neither his father nor his\nmother will ever interfere with him.  All his relations let him\nhave his own way pretty well.  Eh, Charlotte?  He! he! he!`\n\n`Oh, you queer soul!` said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty\nlaugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both\nlooked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on\nthe box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale\npieces which had been specially reserved for him.\n\nNoah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan.  No\nchance-child was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way\nback to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a\nwasherwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a\nwooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an\nunstateable fraction.  The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had\nlong been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets,\nwith the ignominious epithets of `leathers,` `charity,` and the\nlike; and Noah had bourne them without reply.  But, now that\nfortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the\nmeanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with\ninterest.  This affords charming food for contemplation.  It\nshows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be;\nand how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in\nthe finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy.\n"}

It would be very new to have a\nmute in proportion, my dear.  You may depend upon it, it would\nhave a superb effect.`\n\nMrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking\nway, was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it\nwould have been compromising her dignity to have said so, under\nexisting circumstances, she merely inquired, with much sharpness,\nwhy such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her\nhusband`s mind before?  Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this, as\nan acquiescence in his proposition; it was speedily determined,\ntherefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated into the\nmysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he should\naccompany his master on the very next occasion of his services\nbeing required.\n\nThe occasion was not long in coming.  Half an hour after\nbreakfast next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and\nsupporting his cane against the counter, drew forth his large\nleathern pocket-book: from which he selected a small scrap of\npaper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.\n\n`Aha!` said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively\ncountenance; `an order for a coffin, eh?`\n\n`For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,` replied\nMr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book:\nwhich, like himself, was very corpulent.\n\n`Bayton,` said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to\nMr. Bumble.  `I never heard the name before.`\n\nBumble shook his head, as he replied, `Obstinate people, Mr.\nSowerberry; very obstinate.

Oliver, put\non your cap, and come with me.`  Oliver obeyed, and followed his\nmaster on his professional mission.\n\nThey walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and\ndensely inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a\nnarrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet\npassed through, paused to look for the house which was the object\nof their search.  The houses on either side were high and large,\nbut very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as\ntheir neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted,\nwithout the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of\nthe few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half\ndoubled, occasionally skulked along.  A great many of the\ntenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and\nmouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited.  Some\nhouses which had become insecure from age and decay, were\nprevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood\nreared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but\neven these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly\nhaunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards\nwhich supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from\ntheir positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the\npassage of a human body.  The kennel was stagnant and filthy.\nThe very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its\nrottenness, were hideous with famine.\n\nThere was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where\nOliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously\nthrough the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him\nand not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first\nflight of stairs.  Stumbling against a door on the landing, he\nrapped at it with his knuckles.\n\nIt was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen.  The\nundertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know\nit was the apartment to which he had been directed.  He stepped\nin; Oliver followed him.\n\nThere was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching,\nmechanically, over the empty stove.  An old woman, too, had drawn\na low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him.\nThere were some ragged children in another corner; and in a small\nrecess, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something\ncovered with an old blanket.  Oliver shuddered as he cast his\neyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his\nmaster; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a\ncorpse.\n\nThe man`s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were\ngrizzly; his eyes were bloodshot.  The old woman`s face was\nwrinkled; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip;\nand her eyes were bright and piercing.  Oliver was afraid to look\nat either her or the man.  They seemed so like the rats he had\nseen outside.\n\n`Nobody shall go near her,` said the man, starting fiercely up,\nas the undertaker approached the recess. `Keep back! Damn you,\nkeep back, if you`ve a life to lose!`\n"}

Having unloosened the\ncravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground, she\ntottered towards the undertaker.\n\n`She was my daughter,` said the old woman, nodding her head in\nthe direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer,\nmore ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place.\n`Lord, Lord!

I laid her out; and\nI must walk, you know.  Send me a large cloak: a good warm one:\nfor it is bitter cold.  We should have cake and wine, too, before\nwe go!  Never mind; send some bread--only a loaf of bread and a\ncup of water.  Shall we have some bread, dear?` she said eagerly:\ncatching at the undertaker`s coat, as he once more moved towards\nthe door.\n\n`Yes, yes,` said the undertaker,`of course.  Anything you like!`\nHe disengaged himself from the old woman`s grasp; and, drawing\nOliver after him, hurried away.\n"}

{"text":"\nThe next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a\nhalf-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr.\nBumble himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable\nabode; where Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four\nmen from the workhouse, who were to act as bearers.  An old black\ncloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man;\nand the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the\nshoulders of the bearers, and carried into the street.\n\n`Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!` whispered\nSowerberry in the old woman`s ear; `we are rather late; and it\nwon`t do, to keep the clergyman waiting.  Move on, my men,--as\nquick as you like!`\n\nThus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden;\nand the two mourners kept as near them, as they could.  Mr.\nBumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and\nOliver, whose legs were not so long as his master`s, ran by the\nside.\n\nThere was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry\nhad anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure\ncorner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the\nparish graves were made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the\nclerk, who was sitting by the vestry-room fire, seemed to think\nit by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so, before\nhe came.  So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave; and\nthe two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold\nrain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had\nattracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at\nhide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by\njumping backwards and forwards over the coffin.  Mr. Sowerberry\nand Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire\nwith him, and read the paper.\n\nAt length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr.\nBumble, and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards\nthe grave.  Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared:\nputting on his surplice as he came along.  Mr. Bumble then\nthrashed a boy or two, to keep up appearances; and the reverend\ngentleman, having read as much of the burial service as could be\ncompressed into four minutes, gave his surplice to the clerk, and\nwalked away again.\n\n`Now, Bill!` said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. `Fill up!`\n\nIt was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that\nthe uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface.  The\ngrave-digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with\nhis feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the\nboys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so\nsoon.\n\n`Come, my good fellow!` said Bumble, tapping the man on the back.\n`They want to shut up the yard.`\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER VI\n\nOLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION,\nAND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM\n\nThe month`s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed.  It was\na nice sickly season just at this time.  In commercial phrase,\ncoffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks,\nOliver acquired a great deal of experience.  The success of Mr.\nSowerberry`s ingenious speculation, exceeded even his most\nsanguine hopes.  The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at\nwhich measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant\nexistence; and many were the mournful processions which little\nOliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to his knees, to the\nindescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the\ntown.  As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult\nexpeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity\nof demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a\nfinished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the\nbeautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded\npeople bear their trials and losses.\n\nFor instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some\nrich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number\nof nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during\nthe previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly\nirrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as\nhappy among themselves as need be--quite cheerful and\ncontented--conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety,\nas if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them.  Husbands,\ntoo, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness.\nWives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from\ngrieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to\nrender it as becoming and attractive as possible.  It was\nobservable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions\nof anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as\nsoon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the\ntea-drinking was over.  All this was very pleasant and improving\nto see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.\n\nThat Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of\nthese good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer,\nundertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can most\ndistinctly say, that for many months he continued meekly to\nsubmit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who\nused him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused\nby seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband,\nwhile he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap and\nleathers.  Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs.\nSowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was\ndisposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side,\nand a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as\ncomfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by\nmistake, in the grain department of a brewery.\n"}

{"text":"\nAnd now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver`s history;\nfor I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in\nappearance, but which indirectly produced a material change in\nall his future prospects and proceedings.\n\nOne day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the\nusual dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton--a\npound and a half of the worst end of the neck--when Charlotte\nbeing called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval of\ntime, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered\nhe could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than\naggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.\n\nIntent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the\ntable-cloth; and pulled Oliver`s hair; and twitched his ears; and\nexpressed his opinion that he was a `sneak`; and furthermore\nannounced his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever\nthat desirable event should take place; and entered upon various\ntopics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned\ncharity-boy as he was.  But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to\nbe more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many\nsometimes do to this day, when they want to be funny.  He got\nrather personal.\n\n`Work`us,` said Noah, `how`s your mother?`\n\n`She`s dead,` replied Oliver; `don`t you say anything about her\nto me!`\n\nOliver`s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and\nthere was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr.\nClaypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit\nof crying.  Under this impression he returned to the charge.\n\n`What did she die of, Work`us?` said Noah.\n\n`Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,` replied\nOliver: more as if he were talking to himself, than answering\nNoah. `I think I know what it must be to die of that!`\n\n`Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work`us,` said Noah, as a\ntear rolled down Oliver`s cheek.  `What`s set you a snivelling\nnow?`\n\n`Not _you_,` replied Oliver, sharply. `There; that`s enough. Don`t\nsay anything more to me about her; you`d better not!`\n\n`Better not!` exclaimed Noah. `Well!  Better not!  Work`us,\ndon`t be impudent.  _Your_ mother, too!  She was a nice `un she\nwas.  Oh, Lor!`  And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and\ncurled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could\ncollect together, for the occasion.\n\n`Yer know, Work`us,` continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver`s\nsilence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all\ntones the most annoying: `Yer know, Work`us, it can`t be helped\nnow; and of course yer couldn`t help it then; and I am very sorry\nfor it; and I`m sure we all are, and pity yer very much.  But yer\nmust know, Work`us, yer mother was a regular right-down bad `un.`\n\n`What did you say?` inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.\n"}

But his spirit was\nroused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his\nblood on fire.  His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his\neye bright and vivid; his whole person changed, as he stood\nglaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his\nfeet; and defied him with an energy he had never known before.\n\n`He`ll murder me!` blubbered Noah.  `Charlotte!  missis!  Here`s\nthe new boy a murdering of me!  Help! help!  Oliver`s gone mad!\nChar--lotte!`\n\nNoah`s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte,\nand a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into\nthe kitchen by a side-door, while the latter paused on the\nstaircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with\nthe preservation of human life, to come further down.\n\n`Oh, you little wretch!` screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with\nher utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately\nstrong man in particularly good training.  `Oh, you little\nun-grate-ful, mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!`  And between every\nsyllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might:\naccompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of society.\n\nCharlotte`s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should\nnot be effectual in calming Oliver`s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry\nplunged into the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand,\nwhile she scratched his face with the other. In this favourable\nposition of affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him\nbehind.\n\nThis was rather too violent exercise to last long.  When they\nwere all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they\ndragged Oliver, struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted,\ninto the dust-cellar, and there locked him up.  This being done,\nMrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair, and burst into tears.\n\n`Bless her, she`s going off!` said Charlotte.  `A glass of water,\nNoah, dear.  Make haste!`\n"}

I only hope this`ll\nteach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures,\nthat are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle.\nPoor Noah!

You can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along.\nIt`ll keep the swelling down.`\n\nNoah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest\nspeed; and very much it astonished the people who were out\nwalking, to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets\npell-mell, with no cap on his head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY\n\nNoah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and\npaused not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate.\nHaving rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst\nof sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked\nloudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the\naged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but\nrueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in\nastonishment.\n\n`Why, what`s the matter with the boy!` said the old pauper.\n\n`Mr. Bumble!  Mr. Bumble!` cried Noah, with well-affected dismay:\nand in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the\near of Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but\nalarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his\ncocked hat,--which is a very curious and remarkable\ncircumstance: as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden\nand powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary\nvisitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of\npersonal dignity.\n\n`Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!` said Noah:  `Oliver, sir,--Oliver has--`\n\n`What?  What?` interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure\nin his metallic eyes. `Not run away; he hasn`t run away, has he,\nNoah?`\n\n`No, sir, no.

Oh! what dreadful pain it is!\n\nSuch agony, please, sir!`  And here, Noah writhed and twisted his\nbody into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby\ngiving Mr. Bumble to understand that, from the violent and\nsanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe\ninternal injury and damage, from which he was at that moment\nsuffering the acutest torture.\n\nWhen Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly\nparalysed Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by\nbewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and\nwhen he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the\nyard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever: rightly\nconceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse\nthe indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid.\n\nThe gentleman`s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not\nwalked three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired\nwhat that young cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not\nfavour him with something which would render the series of\nvocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary process?\n\n`It`s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,` replied Mr. Bumble,\n`who has been nearly murdered--all but murdered, sir,--by young\nTwist.`\n"}

Here`s a penny for you.  Bumble, just step up to\nSowerberry`s with your cane, and see what`s best to be done.\nDon`t spare him, Bumble.`\n\n`No, I will not, sir,` replied the beadle.

Sowerberry\nhad not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with\nundiminished vigour, at the cellar-door.  The accounts of his\nferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so\nstartling a nature, that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley,\nbefore opening the door.  With this view he gave a kick at the\noutside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his mouth to the\nkeyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:\n\n`Oliver!`\n\n`Come; you let me out!` replied Oliver, from the inside.\n\n`Do you know this here voice, Oliver?` said Mr. Bumble.\n\n`Yes,` replied Oliver.\n\n`Ain`t you afraid of it, sir?  Ain`t you a-trembling while I\nspeak, sir?` said Mr. Bumble.\n\n`No!` replied Oliver, boldly.\n\nAn answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit,\nand was in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a\nlittle.  He stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his\nfull height; and looked from one to another of the three\nbystanders, in mute astonishment.\n"}

Of which, to do her justice, she was wholly\ninnocent, in thought, word, or deed.\n\n`Ah!` said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to\nearth again; `the only thing that can be done now, that I know\nof, is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he`s a\nlittle starved down; and then to take him out, and keep him on\ngruel all through the apprenticeship.

Sowerberry returned at this juncture.  Oliver`s\noffence having been explained to him, with such exaggerations as\nthe ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked\nthe cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious\napprentice out, by the collar.\n\nOliver`s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received;\nhis face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over\nhis forehead.  The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and\nwhen he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah,\nand looked quite undismayed.\n\n`Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain`t you?` said Sowerberry;\ngiving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.\n"}

If he\nhad hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it\nmust be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would\nhave been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony\nestablished, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting\ncreature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable\ncharacters too numerous for recital within the limits of this\nchapter.  To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went--it\nwas not very extensive--kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps,\nbecause it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife\ndisliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no resource;\nso he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.\nSowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble`s subsequent\napplication of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary.  For the\nrest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company\nwith a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry,\nafter making various remarks outside the door, by no means\ncomplimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room,\nand, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte,\nordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.\n\nIt was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness\nof the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to\nthe feelings which the day`s treatment may be supposed likely to\nhave awakened in a mere child.  He had listened to their taunts\nwith a look of contempt; he had borne the lash without a cry:\nfor he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have\nkept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him\nalive.  But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he fell\nupon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands,\nwept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so\nyoung may ever have cause to pour out before him!\n\nFor a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The\ncandle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet.\nHaving gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he\ngently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.\n\nIt was a cold, dark night.  The stars seemed, to the boy`s eyes,\nfarther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there\nwas no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the\nground, looked sepulchral and death-like, from being so still.\nHe softly reclosed the door.  Having availed himself of the\nexpiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few\narticles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down upon a\nbench, to wait for morning.\n\nWith the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices\nin the shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door.  One\ntimid look around--one moment`s pause of hesitation--he had\nclosed it behind him, and was in the open street.\n\nHe looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.\n"}

They had been beaten, and starved,\nand shut up together, many and many a time.\n\n`Hush, Dick!` said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust\nhis thin arm between the rails to greet him.  `Is any one up?`\n\n`Nobody but me,` replied the child.\n\n`You musn`t say you saw me, Dick,` said Oliver.  `I am running\naway.  They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my\nfortune, some long way off.  I don`t know where.  How pale you\nare!`\n\n`I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,` replied the child\nwith a faint smile.  `I am very glad to see you, dear; but don`t\nstop, don`t stop!`\n\n`Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b`ye to you,` replied Oliver. `I\nshall see you again, Dick.  I know I shall!  You will be well and\nhappy!`\n\n`I hope so,` replied the child.  `After I am dead, but not\nbefore.  I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream\nso much of Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see\nwhen I am awake.  Kiss me,` said the child,  climbing up the low\ngate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver`s neck.\n`Good-b`ye, dear!  God bless you!`\n\nThe blessing was from a young child`s lips, but it was the first\nthat Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the\nstruggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after\nlife, he never once forgot it.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOLIVER WALKS TO LONDON.  HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT\nOF YOUNG GENTLEMAN\n\nOliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and\nonce more gained the high-road.  It was eight o`clock now. Though\nhe was nearly five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid\nbehind the hedges, by turns, till noon: fearing that he might be\npursued and overtaken.  Then he sat down to rest by the side of\nthe milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he\nhad better go and try to live.\n\nThe stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an\nintimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to\nLondon. The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy`s mind.\n\nLondon!--that great place!--nobody--not even Mr. Bumble--could\never find him there!  He had often heard the old men in the\nworkhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London;\nand that there were ways of living in that vast city, which those\nwho had been bred up in country parts had no idea of.  It was the\nvery place for a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless\nsome one helped him. As these things passed through his thoughts,\nhe jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward.\n\nHe had diminished the distance between himself and London by full\nfour miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo\nere he could hope to reach his place of destination. As this\nconsideration forced itself upon him, he slackened his pace a\nlittle, and meditated upon his means of getting there.  He had a\ncrust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in\nhis bundle.  He had a penny too--a gift of Sowerberry`s after\nsome funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than\nordinarily well--in his pocket. `A clean shirt,` thought Oliver,\n`is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned\nstockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a\nsixty-five miles` walk in winter time.`  But Oliver`s thoughts,\nlike those of most other people, although they were extremely\nready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a\nloss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after\na good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his\nlittle bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.\n\nOliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted\nnothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water,\nwhich he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side.  When the\nnight came, he turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a\nhay-rick, determined to lie there, till morning.  He felt\nfrightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty\nfields: and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he had\never felt before.  Being very tired with his walk, however, he\nsoon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.\n\nHe felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so\nhungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small\nloaf, in the very first village through which he passed.  He had\nwalked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again.\nHis feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled\nbeneath him.  Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made\nhim worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he\ncould hardly crawl along.\n\nHe waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came\nup, and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were\nvery few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to\nwait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see\nhow far he could run for a halfpenny.  Poor Oliver tried to keep\nup with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by\nreason of his fatigue and sore feet.  When the outsides saw this,\nthey put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring\nthat he was an idle young dog, and didn`t deserve anything; and\nthe coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind.\n"}

{"text":"\nIn some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all\npersons who begged within the district, that they would be sent\nto jail.  This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to\nget out of those villages with all possible expedition.  In\nothers, he would stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully\nat every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated\nin the landlady`s ordering one of the post-boys who were lounging\nabout, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she was\nsure he had come to steal something.  If he begged at a farmer`s\nhouse, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and\nwhen he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the\nbeadle--which brought Oliver`s heart into his mouth,--very often\nthe only thing he had there, for many hours together.\n\nIn fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and\na benevolent old lady, Oliver`s troubles would have been\nshortened by the very same process which had put an end to his\nmother`s; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen\ndead upon the king`s highway.  But the turnpike-man gave him a\nmeal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked\ngrandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth,\ntook pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she\ncould afford--and more--with such kind and gentle words, and such\ntears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into\nOliver`s soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.\n\nEarly on the seventh morning after he had left his native place,\nOliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The\nwindow-shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had\nawakened to the business of the day.  The sun was rising in all\nits splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy\nhis own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat, with bleeding\nfeet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.\n\nBy degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were\ndrawn up; and people began passing to and fro.  Some few stopped\nto gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare\nat him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled\nthemselves to inquire how he came there. He had no heart to beg.\nAnd there he sat.\n\nHe had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at\nthe great number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet\nwas a tavern, large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches\nas they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that\nthey could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a\nwhole week of courage and determination beyond his years to\naccomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had\npassed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was\nnow surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the\nway.  He took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained\nin the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver\nraised his head, and returned his steady look.  Upon this, the\nboy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,\n\n`Hullo, my covey!  What`s the row?`\n"}

{"text":"\nThe boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was\nabout his own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that\nOliver had even seen.  He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed,\ncommon-faced boy enough; and as dirty a juvenile as one would\nwish to see; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a\nman.  He was short of his age: with rather bow-legs, and little,\nsharp, ugly eyes.  His hat was stuck on the top of his head so\nlightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment--and would\nhave done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of\nevery now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought\nit back to its old place again.  He wore a man`s coat, which\nreached nearly to his heels.  He had turned the cuffs back,\nhalf-way up his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves:\napparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the\npockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them.  He\nwas, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman\nas ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers.\n\n`Hullo, my covey!  What`s the row?` said this strange young\ngentleman to Oliver.\n\n`I am very hungry and tired,` replied Oliver: the tears standing\nin his eyes as he spoke. `I have walked a long way.  I have been\nwalking these seven days.`\n\n`Walking for sivin days!` said the young gentleman.  `Oh, I see.\nBeak`s order, eh?  But,` he added, noticing Oliver`s look of\nsurprise, `I suppose you don`t know what a beak is, my flash\ncom-pan-i-on.`\n\nOliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird`s mouth\ndescribed by the term in question.\n\n`My eyes, how green!` exclaimed the young gentleman. `Why, a\nbeak`s a madgst`rate; and when you walk by a beak`s order, it`s\nnot straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming\ndown agin.  Was you never on the mill?`\n\n`What mill?` inquired Oliver.\n\n`What mill!  Why, _the_ mill--the mill as takes up so little room\nthat it`ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when\nthe wind`s low with people, than when it`s high; acos then they\ncan`t get workmen.  But come,` said the young gentleman; `you\nwant grub, and you shall have it.  I`m at low-water-mark\nmyself--only one bob and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I`ll\nfork out and stump.  Up with you on your pins.  There!  Now then!\n`Morrice!`\n\nAssisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an\nadjacent chandler`s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of\nready-dressed ham and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself\nexpressed it, `a fourpenny bran!` the ham being kept clean and\npreserved from dust, by the ingenious expedient of making a hole\nin the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb, and stuffing\nit therein.  Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentlman\nturned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room\nin the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer was brought in,\nby direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at\nhis new friend`s bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the\nprogress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with\ngreat attention.\n\n`Going to London?` said the strange boy, when Oliver had at\nlength concluded.\n\n`Yes.`\n\n`Got any lodgings?`\n\n`No.`\n\n`Money?`\n"}

{"text":"\n`No.`\n\nThe strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as\nfar as the big coat-sleeves would let them go.\n\n`Do you live in London?` inquired Oliver.\n\n`Yes. I do, when I`m at home,` replied the boy. `I suppose you\nwant some place to sleep in to-night, don`t you?`\n\n`I do, indeed,` answered Oliver. `I have not slept under a roof\nsince I left the country.`\n\n`Don`t fret your eyelids on that score,` said the young\ngentleman. `I`ve got to be in London to-night; and I know a\n`spectable old gentleman as lives there, wot`ll give you lodgings\nfor nothink, and never ask for the change--that is, if any\ngenelman he knows interduces you. And don`t he know me?  Oh, no!\nNot in the least!  By no means.  Certainly not!`\n\nThe young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter\nfragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the\nbeer as he did so.\n\nThis unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;\nespecially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance\nthat the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide\nOliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time.  This led\nto a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver\ndiscovered that his friend`s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he\nwas a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before\nmentioned.\n\nMr. Dawkin`s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the\ncomforts which his patron`s interest obtained for those whom he\ntook under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and\ndissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among\nhis intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of `The\nArtful Dodger,` Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and\ncareless turn, the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto\nbeen thrown away upon him.  Under this impression, he secretly\nresolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as\nquickly as possible; and, if he found the Dodger incorrigible, as\nhe more than half suspected he should, to decline the honour of\nhis farther acquaintance.\n\nAs John Dawkins objected to their entering London before\nnightfall, it was nearly eleven o`clock when they reached the\nturnpike at Islington.  They crossed from the Angel into St.\nJohn`s Road; struck down the small street which terminates at\nSadler`s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row;\ndown the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the\nclassic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole;\nthence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the\nGreat: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing\nOliver to follow close at his heels.\n\nAlthough Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping\nsight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty\nglances on either side of the way, as he passed along.  A dirtier\nor more wretched place he had never seen.  The street was very\nnarrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours.\n"}

{"text":"\nThere were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade\nappeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of\nnight, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from\nthe inside.  The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the\ngeneral blight of the place, were the public-houses; and in them,\nthe lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main.\nCovered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from the\nmain street, disclosed little knots of houses, where drunken men\nand women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of\nthe door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were cautiously\nemerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed or\nharmless errands.\n\nOliver was just considering whether he hadn`t better run away,\nwhen they reached the bottom of the hill.  His conductor,\ncatching him by the arm, pushed open the door of a house near\nField Lane; and drawing him into the passage, closed it behind\nthem.\n\n`Now, then!` cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from\nthe Dodger.\n\n`Plummy and slam!` was the reply.\n\nThis seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right;\nfor the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the\nremote end of the passage; and a man`s face peeped out, from\nwhere a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken\naway.\n\n`There`s two on you,` said the man, thrusting the candle farther\nout, and shielding his eyes with his hand.  `Who`s the t`other\none?`\n\n`A new pal,` replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.\n\n`Where did he come from?`\n\n`Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs?`\n\n`Yes, he`s a sortin` the wipes.  Up with you!`  The candle was\ndrawn back, and the face disappeared.\n\nOliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other\nfirmly grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty\nthe dark and broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an\nease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them.\n\nHe threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after\nhim.\n\nThe walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age\nand dirt.  There was a deal table before the fire: upon which\nwere a candle, stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter\npots, a loaf and butter, and a plate.  In a frying-pan, which was\non the fire, and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a\nstring, some sausages were cooking; and standing over them, with\na toasting-fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose\nvillainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity\nof matted red hair. He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with\nhis throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his attention between\nthe frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which a great number\nof silk handkerchiefs were hanging.  Several rough beds made of\nold sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round\nthe table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger,\nsmoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of\nmiddle-aged men.  These all crowded about their associate as he\nwhispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and\ngrinned at Oliver.  So did the Jew himself, toasting-fork in\nhand.\n\n`This is him, Fagin,` said Jack Dawkins;`my friend Oliver\nTwist.`\n"}

{"text":"\nThe Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him\nby the hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate\nacquaintance.  Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came\nround him, and shook both his hands very hard--especially the one\nin which he held his little bundle.  One young gentleman was very\nanxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so obliging\nas to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very\ntired, he might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself,\nwhen he went to bed.  These civilities would probably be extended\nmuch farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew`s\ntoasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate\nyouths who offered them.\n\n`We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,` said the Jew.\n`Dodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for\nOliver.

{"text":"\nCHAPTER IX\n\nCONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD\nGENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS\n\nIt was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long\nsleep. There was no other person in the room but the old Jew,\nwho was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and\nwhistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round,\nwith an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen\nwhen there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied\nhimself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.\n\nAlthough Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not\nthoroughly awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and\nwaking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half\nopen, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing\naround you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast\nclosed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness. At\nsuch time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing,\nto form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its\nbounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from\nthe restraint of its corporeal associate.\n\nOliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his\nhalf-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the\nsound of the spoon grating against the saucepan`s sides: and yet\nthe self-same senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in\nbusy action with almost everybody he had ever known.\n\nWhen the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.\nStanding, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if\nhe did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and\nlooked at Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer,\nand was to all appearances asleep.\n\nAfter satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently\nto the door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it\nseemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor: a small box,\nwhich he placed carefully on the table. His eyes glistened as he\nraised the lid, and looked in. Dragging an old chair to the\ntable, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch,\nsparkling with jewels.\n\n`Aha!` said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting\nevery feature with a hideous grin. `Clever dogs! Clever dogs!\nStaunch to the last! Never told the old parson where they were.\nNever poached upon old Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn`t\nhave loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer.\nNo, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!`\n\nWith these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature,\nthe Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At\nleast half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same\nbox, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches,\nbracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent\nmaterials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even\nof their names.\n\nHaving replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so\nsmall that it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be\nsome very minute inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon\nthe table, and shading it with his hand, pored over it, long and\nearnestly. At length he put it down, as if despairing of\nsuccess; and, leaning back in his chair, muttered:\n\n`What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent;\ndead men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it`s a fine\nthing for the trade! Five of `em strung up in a row, and none\nleft to play booty, or turn white-livered!`\n\nAs the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had\nbeen staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver`s face; the\nboy`s eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the\nrecognition was only for an instant--for the briefest space of\ntime that can possibly be conceived--it was enough to show the\nold man that he had been observed.\n"}

{"text":"\nHe closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his\nhand on a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously\nup. He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror,\nOliver could see that the knife quivered in the air.\n\n`What`s that?` said the Jew. `What do you watch me for? Why are\nyou awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick--quick!\nfor your life.\n\n`I wasn`t able to sleep any longer, sir,` replied Oliver, meekly.\n`I am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.`\n\n`You were not awake an hour ago?` said the Jew, scowling fiercely\non the boy.\n\n`No! No, indeed!` replied Oliver.\n\n`Are you sure?` cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than\nbefore: and a threatening attitude.\n\n`Upon my word I was not, sir,` replied Oliver, earnestly. `I was\nnot, indeed, sir.`\n\n`Tush, tush, my dear!` said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old\nmanner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it\ndown; as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in\nmere sport. `Of course I know that, my dear. I only tried to\nfrighten you. You`re a brave boy. Ha! ha! you`re a brave boy,\nOliver.` The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced\nuneasily at the box, notwithstanding.\n\n`Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?` said the Jew,\nlaying his hand upon it after a short pause.\n\n`Yes, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\n`Ah!` said the Jew, turning rather pale. `They--they`re mine,\nOliver; my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old\nage. The folks call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that`s\nall.`\n\nOliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live\nin such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that\nperhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him\na good deal of money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew,\nand asked if he might get up.\n\n`Certainly, my dear, certainly,` replied the old gentleman.\n`Stay.  There`s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door.\nBring it here; and I`ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.`\n\nOliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant\nto raise the pitcher.  When he turned his head, the box was gone.\n"}

{"text":"\nHe had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by\nemptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew`s\ndirections, when the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very\nsprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen smoking on the\nprevious night, and who was now formally introduced to him as\nCharley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee,\nand some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in\nthe crown of his hat.\n\n`Well,` said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing\nhimself to the Dodger, `I hope you`ve been at work this morning,\nmy dears?`\n\n`Hard,` replied the Dodger.\n\n`As nails,` added Charley Bates.\n\n`Good boys, good boys!` said the Jew. `What have you got,\nDodger?`\n\n`A couple of pocket-books,` replied that young gentlman.\n\n`Lined?` inquired the Jew, with eagerness.\n\n`Pretty well,` replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books;\none green, and the other red.\n\n`Not so heavy as they might be,` said the Jew, after looking at\nthe insides carefully; `but very neat and nicely made.

Ha! ha! ha!`\n\n`If you please, sir,` said Oliver.\n\n`You`d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as\nCharley Bates, wouldn`t you, my dear?` said the Jew.\n\n`Very much, indeed, if you`ll teach me, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\nMaster Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this\nreply, that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the\ncoffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel,\nvery nearly terminated in his premature suffocation.\n\n`He is so jolly green!` said Charley when he recovered, as an\napology to the company for his unpolite behaviour.\n\nThe Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver`s hair over his\neyes, and said he`d know better, by and by; upon which the old\ngentleman, observing Oliver`s colour mounting, changed the\nsubject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the\nexecution that morning? This made him wonder more and more; for\nit was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both\nbeen there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly\nhave found time to be so very industrious.\n"}

{"text":"\nWhen the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and\nthe two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which\nwas performed in this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a\nsnuff-box in one pocket of his trousers, a note-case in the\nother, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain\nround his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt:\nbuttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his spectacle-case\nand handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the room\nwith a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen\nwalk about the streets any hour in the day.  Sometimes he stopped\nat the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that\nhe was staring with all his might into shop-windows.  At such\ntimes, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves,\nand would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he\nhadn`t lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner,\nthat Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face.  All this\ntime, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of\nhis sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was\nimpossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod\nupon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley\nBates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they\ntook from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box,\nnote-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief,\neven the spectacle-case.  If the old gentlman felt a hand in any\none of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game\nbegan all over again.\n\nWhen this game had been played a great many times, a couple of\nyoung ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was\nnamed Bet, and the other Nancy.  They wore a good deal of hair,\nnot very neatly turned up behind, and were rather untidy about\nthe shoes and stockings.  They were not exactly pretty, perhaps;\nbut they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked\nquite stout and hearty.  Being remarkably free and agreeable in\ntheir manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed.  As\nthere is no doubt they were.\n\nThe visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in\nconsequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness\nin her inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and\nimproving turn. At length, Charley Bates expressed his opinion\nthat it was time to pad the hoof.  This, it occurred to Oliver,\nmust be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the\nDodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away\ntogether, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew\nwith money to spend.\n\n`There, my dear,` said Fagin. `That`s a pleasant life, isn`t it?\nThey have gone out for the day.`\n\n`Have they done work, sir?` inquired Oliver.\n\n`Yes,` said the Jew; `that is, unless they should unexpectedly\ncome across any, when they are out; and they won`t neglect it, if\nthey do, my dear, depend upon it.  Make `em your models, my dear.\nMake `em your models,` tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to\nadd force to his words; `do everything they bid you, and take\ntheir advice in all matters--especially the Dodger`s, my dear.\nHe`ll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you\ntake pattern by him.--Is my handkerchief hanging out of my\npocket, my dear?` said the Jew, stopping short.\n\n`Yes, sir,` said Oliver.\n\n`See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw\nthem do, when we were at play this morning.`\n\nOliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had\nseen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of\nit with the other.\n\n`Is it gone?` cried the Jew.\n\n`Here it is, sir,` said Oliver, showing it in his hand.\n\n`You`re a clever boy, my dear,` said the playful old gentleman,\npatting Oliver on the head approvingly. `I never saw a sharper\nlad. Here`s a shilling for you. If you go on, in this way,\nyou`ll be the greatest man of the time. And now come here, and\nI`ll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs.`\n\nOliver wondered what picking the old gentleman`s pocket in play,\nhad to do with his chances of being a great man.  But, thinking\nthat the Jew, being so much his senior, must know best, he\nfollowed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved\nin his new study.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER X\n\nOLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW\nASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A\nSHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY\n\nFor many days, Oliver remained in the Jew`s room, picking the\nmarks out of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number\nwere brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already\ndescribed: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly,\nevery morning. At length, he began to languish for fresh air, and\ntook many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to\nallow him to go out to work with his two companions.\n\nOliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by\nwhat he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman`s\ncharacter. Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at\nnight, empty-handed, he would expatiate with great vehemence on\nthe misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them\nthe necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to\nbed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock\nthem both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his\nvirtuous precepts to an unusual extent.\n\nAt length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so\neagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon,\nfor two or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre.\nPerhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman`s giving his\nassent; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go,\nand placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and\nhis friend the Dodger.\n\nThe three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves\ntucked up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering\nalong with his hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them,\nwondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture\nhe would be instructed in, first.\n\nThe pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking\nsaunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were\ngoing to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all.\nThe Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps\nfrom the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas; while\nCharley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the\nrights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from\nthe stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets\nwhich were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to\nundermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction. These\nthings looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring\nhis intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could;\nwhen his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by\na very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.\n\nThey were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open\nsquare in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange\nperversion of terms, `The Green`: when the Dodger made a sudden\nstop; and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions back\nagain, with the greatest caution and circumspection.\n\n`What`s the matter?` demanded Oliver.\n\n`Hush!` replied the Dodger. `Do you see that old cove at the\nbook-stall?`\n"}

{"text":"\n`The old gentleman over the way?` said Oliver. `Yes, I see him.`\n\n`He`ll do,` said the Doger.\n\n`A prime plant,` observed Master Charley Bates.\n\nOliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise;\nbut he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys\nwalked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old\ngentleman towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver\nwalked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to\nadvance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement.\n\nThe old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with\na powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a\nbottle-green coat with a black velvet collar; wore white\ntrousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had\ntaken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away,\nas hard as if he were in his elbow-chair, in his own study. It\nis very possible that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it\nwas plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the book-stall,\nnor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the\nbook itself: which he was reading straight through: turning\nover the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at\nthe top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the\ngreatest interest and eagerness.\n\nWhat was Oliver`s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off,\nlooking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly\ngo, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman`s\npocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief! To see him hand the\nsame to Charley Bates; and finally to behold them, both running\naway round the corner at full speed!\n\nIn an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the\nwatches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy`s mind.\n\nHe stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all\nhis veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning\nfire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and,\nnot knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his\nfeet to the ground.\n\nThis was all done in a minute`s space. In the very instant when\nOliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his\npocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing\nthe boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally\nconcluded him to be the depredator; and shouting `Stop thief!`\nwith all his might, made off after him, book in hand.\n\nBut the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the\nhue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract\npublic attention by running down the open street, had merely\nretired into the very first doorway round the corner. They no\nsooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing\nexactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great\npromptitude; and, shouting `Stop thief!` too, joined in the\npursuit like good citizens.\n"}

He meant this to be\nironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley\nBates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to.\n\n`Come, get up!`\n\n`Don`t hurt him,` said the old gentleman, compassionately.\n\n`Oh no, I won`t hurt him,` replied the officer, tearing his\njacket half off his back, in proof thereof.  `Come, I know you;\nit won`t do.

The crowd had only the satisfaction of\naccompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a\nplace called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway,\nand up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by\nthe back way.  It was a small paved yard into which they turned;\nand here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on\nhis face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.\n\n`What`s the matter now?` said the man carelessly.\n\n`A young fogle-hunter,` replied the man who had Oliver in charge.\n\n`Are you the party that`s been robbed, sir?` inquired the man\nwith the keys.\n\n`Yes, I am,` replied the old gentleman; `but I am not sure that\nthis boy actually took the handkerchief.

It was most intolerably dirty; for it was\nMonday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people,\nwho had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night.  But\nthis is little.

So, he heaved a sigh over the\nrecollections he awakened; and being, happily for himself, an\nabsent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty\nbook.\n\nHe was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the\nman with the keys to follow him into the office.

Little\nOliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement, with his shirt\nunbuttoned, and his temples bathed with water; his face a deadly\nwhite; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame.\n\n`Poor boy, poor boy!` said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. `Call\na coach, somebody, pray.

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE.\nAND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND\nHIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS.\n\nThe coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which\nOliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with\nthe Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the\nAngel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a\nquiet shady street near Pentonville.  Here, a bed was prepared,\nwithout loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge\ncarefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with\na kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds.\n\nBut, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the\ngoodness of his new friends.  The sun rose and sank, and rose and\nsank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay\nstretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and\nwasting heat of fever.  The worm does not work more surely on the\ndead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living\nframe.\n\nWeak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to\nhave been a long and troubled dream.  Feebly raising himself in\nthe bed, with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked\nanxiously around.\n\n`What room is this?  Where have I been brought to?` said Oliver.\n`This is not the place I went to sleep in.`\n\nHe uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and\nweak; but they were overheard at once.  The curtain at the bed`s\nhead was hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly\nand precisely dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair\nclose by, in which she had been sitting at needle-work.\n\n`Hush, my dear,` said the old lady softly.  `You must be very\nquiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,--as\nbad as bad could be, pretty nigh.  Lie down again; there`s a\ndear!`  With those words, the old lady very gently placed\nOliver`s head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from\nhis forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he\ncould not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and\ndrawing it round his neck.\n\n`Save us!` said the old lady, with tears in her eyes.  `What a\ngrateful little dear it is.  Pretty creetur!  What would his\nmother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him\nnow!`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Perhaps she does see me,` whispered Oliver, folding his hands\ntogether; `perhaps she has sat by me.  I almost feel as if she\nhad.`\n\n`That was the fever, my dear,` said the old lady mildly.\n\n`I suppose it was,` replied Oliver, `because heaven is a long way\noff; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of\na poor boy.  But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me,\neven there; for she was very ill herself before she died.  She\ncan`t know anything about me though,` added Oliver after a\nmoment`s silence.  `If she had seen me hurt, it would have made\nher sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy,\nwhen I have dreamed of her.`\n\nThe old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first,\nand her spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as\nif they were part and parcel of those features, brought some cool\nstuff for Oliver to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek,\ntold him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again.\n\nSo, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey\nthe kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth,\nbecause he was completely exhausted with what he had already\nsaid.  He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was\nawakened by the light of a candle:  which, being brought near the\nbed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking\ngold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a\ngreat deal better.\n\n`You _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?` said the\ngentleman.\n\n`Yes, thank you, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\n`Yes,  I know you are,` said the gentleman:  `You`re hungry too,\nan`t you?`\n\n`No, sir,` answered Oliver.\n\n`Hem!` said the gentleman.  `No, I know you`re not.  He is not\nhungry, Mrs. Bedwin,` said the gentleman:  looking very wise.\n\nThe old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which\nseemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man.\nThe doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself.\n\n`You feel sleepy, don`t you, my dear?` said the doctor.\n\n`No, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\n`No,` said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look.\n`You`re not sleepy.  Nor thirsty.  Are you?`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Yes, sir, rather thirsty,` answered Oliver.\n\n`Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,` said the doctor.  `It`s very\nnatural that he should be thirsty.  You may give him a little\ntea, ma`am, and some dry toast without any butter.  Don`t keep\nhim too warm, ma`am; but be careful that you don`t let him be too\ncold; will you have the goodness?`\n\nThe old lady dropped a curtsey.  The doctor, after tasting the\ncool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried\naway:  his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner\nas he went downstairs.\n\nOliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was\nnearly twelve o`clock.  The old lady tenderly bade him good-night\nshortly afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who\nhad just come:  bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small\nPrayer Book and a large nightcap. Putting the latter on her head\nand the former on the table, the old woman, after telling Oliver\nthat she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the\nfire and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at\nfrequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers\nmoans and chokings. These, however, had no worse effect than\ncausing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep\nagain.\n\nAnd thus the night crept slowly on.  Oliver lay awake for some\ntime, counting the little circles of light which the reflection\nof the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with\nhis languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall.\nThe darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn;\nas they brought into the boy`s mind the thought that death had\nbeen hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill\nit with the gloom and dread of his awful presence, he turned his\nface upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to Heaven.\n\nGradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from\nrecent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which\nit is pain to wake from.  Who, if this were death, would be\nroused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all\nits cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more\nthan all, its weary recollections of the past!\n\nIt had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes;\nhe felt cheerful and happy.  The crisis of the disease was safely\npast.  He belonged to the world again.\n\nIn three days` time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well\npropped up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk,\nMrs. Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little\nhousekeeper`s room, which belonged to her.  Having him set, here,\nby the fire-side, the good old lady sat herself down too; and,\nbeing in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much\nbetter, forthwith began to cry most violently.\n\n`Never mind me, my dear,` said the old lady; `I`m only having a\nregular good cry.  There; it`s all over now; and I`m quite\ncomfortable.`\n\n`You`re very, very kind to me, ma`am,` said Oliver.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Well, never you mind that, my dear,` said the old lady; `that`s\ngot nothing to do with your broth; and it`s full time you had it;\nfor the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this\nmorning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we\nlook, the more he`ll be pleased.`  And with this, the old lady\napplied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full\nof broth:  strong enough, Oliver thought, to furnish an ample\ndinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three\nhundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation.\n\n`Are you fond of pictures, dear?` inquired the old lady, seeing\nthat Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait\nwhich hung against the wall; just opposite his chair.\n\n`I don`t quite know, ma`am,` said Oliver, without taking his eyes\nfrom the canvas; `I have seen so few that I hardly know.  What a\nbeautiful, mild face that lady`s is!`\n\n`Ah!` said the old lady, `painters always make ladies out\nprettier than they are, or they wouldn`t get any custom, child.\nThe man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might\nhave known that would never succeed; it`s a deal too honest.  A\ndeal,` said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her own\nacuteness.\n\n`Is--is that a likeness, ma`am?` said Oliver.\n\n`Yes,` said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth;\n`that`s a portrait.`\n\n`Whose, ma`am?` asked Oliver.\n\n`Why, really, my dear, I don`t know,` answered the old lady in a\ngood-humoured manner.  `It`s not a likeness of anybody that you\nor I know, I expect.  It seems to strike your fancy, dear.`\n\n`It is so pretty,` replied Oliver.\n\n`Why, sure you`re not afraid of it?` said the old lady: observing\nin great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded\nthe painting.\n\n`Oh no, no,` returned Oliver quickly; `but the eyes look so\nsorrowful; and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me.  It makes my\nheart beat,` added Oliver in a low voice, `as if it was alive,\nand wanted to speak to me, but couldn`t.`\n\n`Lord save us!` exclaimed the old lady, starting; `don`t talk in\nthat way, child.  You`re weak and nervous after your illness.\nLet me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you\nwon`t see it.  There!` said the old lady, suiting the action to\nthe word; `you don`t see it now, at all events.`\n\nOliver _did_ see it in his mind`s eye as distinctly as if he had\nnot altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry\nthe kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him;\nand Mrs. Bedwin, satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted\nand broke bits of toasted bread into the broth, with all the\nbustle befitting so solemn a preparation. Oliver got through it\nwith extraordinary expedition.  He had scarcely swallowed the\nlast spoonful, when there came a soft rap at the door.  `Come\nin,` said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.\n"}

Oliver looked very worn and shadowy\nfrom sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out\nof respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking\nback into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be\ntold, that Mr. Brownlow`s heart, being large enough for any six\nordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of\ntears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not\nsufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain.\n\n`Poor boy, poor boy!` said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat.\n`I`m rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin.  I`m afraid I have\ncaught cold.`\n\n`I hope not, sir,` said Mrs. Bedwin.  `Everything you have had,\nhas been well aired, sir.`\n\n`I don`t know, Bedwin.

{"text":"\n`Some mistake,` said Mr. Brownlow.  But, although his motive for\nlooking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the\nresemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon\nhim so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze.\n\n`I hope you are not angry with me, sir?` said Oliver, raising his\neyes beseechingly.\n\n`No, no,` replied the old gentleman.  `Why! what`s this?  Bedwin,\nlook there!`\n\nAs he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver`s\nhead, and then to the boy`s face.  There was its living copy. The\neyes, the head, the mouth; every feature was the same. The\nexpression was, for the instant, so precisely alike, that the\nminutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy!\n\nOliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not\nbeing strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted\naway.  A weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an\nopportunity of relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of\nthe two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of\nrecording--\n\nThat when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates,\njoined in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver`s heels, in\nconsequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr.\nBrownlow`s personal property, as has been already described, they\nwere actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for\nthemselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the\nliberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts\nof a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to\nobserve, that this action should tend to exalt them in the\nopinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a\ndegree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own\npreservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the\nlittle code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging\nphilosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all Nature`s\ndeeds and actions:  the said philosophers very wisely reducing\nthe good lady`s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory:  and,\nby a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and\nunderstanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations\nof heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For, these are matters\ntotally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal\nadmission to be far above the numerous little foibles and\nweaknesses of her sex.\n\nIf I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical\nnature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very\ndelicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also\nrecorded in a foregoing part of this narrative), of their\nquitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed upon\nOliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest\npossible cut.  Although I do not mean to assert that it is\nusually the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten\nthe road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being\nrather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and\ndiscursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men\nunder the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to\nindulge); still, I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it\nis the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers, in\ncarrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight\nin providing against every possible contingency which can be\nsupposed at all likely to affect themselves.  Thus, to do a great\nright, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means\nwhich the end to be attained, will justify; the amount of the\nright, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction\nbetween the two, being left entirely to the philosopher\nconcerned, to be settled and determined by his clear,\ncomprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case.\n\nIt was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity,\nthrough a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that\nthey ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway.  Having\nremained silent here, just long enough to recover breath to\nspeak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and\ndelight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter,\nflung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport\nof mirth.\n"}

Come in!`\n\nThe man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow\nof about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled\ndrab breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings\nwhich inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling\ncalves;--the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in\nan unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to\ngarnish them.  He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty\nbelcher handkerchief round his neck:  with the long frayed ends\nof which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke.  He\ndisclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a\nbeard of three days` growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which\ndisplayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently\ndamaged by a blow.\n"}

Lie down!`\n\nThis command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal\nto the other end of the room.  He appeared well used to it,\nhowever; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly,\nwithout uttering a sound, and winking his very ill-looking eyes\ntwenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in taking a\nsurvey of the apartment.\n\n`What are you up to?

He then, in cant terms, with which his whole\nconversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be\nquite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass\nof liquor.\n\n`And mind you don`t poison it,` said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat\nupon the table.\n"}

You must get hold of him somehow.`\n\nAgain the Jew nodded.\n\nThe prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but,\nunfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being\nadopted.

{"text":"\nHow long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state\nof uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult\nto guess.  It is not necessary to make any guesses on the\nsubject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies\nwhom Oliver had seen on a former occasion, caused the\nconversation to flow afresh.\n\n`The very thing!` said the Jew.  `Bet will go; won`t you, my\ndear?`\n\n`Wheres?` inquired the young lady.\n\n`Only just up to the office, my dear,` said the Jew coaxingly.\n\nIt is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively\naffirm that she would not, but that she merely expressed an\nemphatic and earnest desire to be `blessed` if she would; a\npolite and delicate evasion of the request, which shows the young\nlady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which\ncannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a\ndirect and pointed refusal.\n\nThe Jew`s countenance fell.  He turned from this young lady, who\nwas gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green\nboots, and yellow curl-papers, to the other female.\n\n`Nancy, my dear,` said the Jew in a soothing manner, `what do YOU\nsay?`\n\n`That it won`t do; so it`s no use a-trying it on, Fagin,` replied\nNancy.\n\n`What do you mean by that?` said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly\nmanner.\n\n`What I say, Bill,` replied the lady collectedly.\n\n`Why, you`re just the very person for it,` reasoned Mr. Sikes:\n`nobody about here knows anything of you.`\n\n`And as I don`t want `em to, neither,` replied Nancy in the same\ncomposed manner, `it`s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.`\n\n`She`ll go, Fagin,` said Sikes.\n\n`No, she won`t, Fagin,` said Nancy.\n\n`Yes, she will, Fagin,` said Sikes.\n\nAnd Mr. Sikes was right.  By dint of alternate threats, promises,\nand bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to\nundertake the commission.  She was not, indeed, withheld by the\nsame considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently\nremoved into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but\ngenteel suburb of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same\napprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous\nacquaintances.\n\nAccordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her\ncurl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of\ndress being provided from the Jew`s inexhaustible stock,--Miss\nNancy prepared to issue forth on her errand.\n\n`Stop a minute, my dear,` said the Jew, producing, a little\ncovered basket.  `Carry that in one hand.  It looks more\nrespectable, my dear.`\n"}

Very good indeed, my dear!` said the Jew,\nrubbing his hands.\n\n`Oh, my brother!  My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!`\nexclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little\nbasket and the street-door key in an agony of distress.  `What\nhas become of him!

There was no sound within:  so\nshe coughed and listened again.  Still there was no reply:  so\nshe spoke.\n\n`Nolly, dear?` murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; `Nolly?`\n\nThere was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who\nhad been taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence\nagainst society having been clearly proved, had been very\nproperly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one\nmonth; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had\nso much breath to spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on\nthe treadmill than in a musical instrument.  He made no answer:\nbeing occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which\nhad been confiscated for the use of the county:  so Nancy passed\non to the next cell, and knocked there.\n\n`Well!` cried a faint and feeble voice.\n\n`Is there a little boy here?` inquired Nancy, with a preliminary\nsob.\n"}

{"text":"\n`No,` replied the voice; `God forbid.`\n\nThis was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for _not_\nplaying the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the\nstreets, and doing nothing for his livelihood.  In the next cell\nwas another man, who was going to the same prison for hawking tin\nsaucepans without license; thereby doing something for his\nliving, in defiance of the Stamp-office.\n\nBut, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of\nOliver, or knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the\nbluff officer in the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous\nwailings and lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and\nefficient use of the street-door key and the little basket,\ndemanded her own dear brother.\n\n`I haven`t got him, my dear,` said the old man.\n\n`Where is he?` screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.\n\n`Why, the gentleman`s got him,` replied the officer.\n\n`What gentleman!  Oh, gracious heavens!  What gentleman?`\nexclaimed Nancy.\n\nIn reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the\ndeeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the\noffice, and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved\nthe robbery to have been committed by another boy, not in\ncustody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away, in an\ninsensible condition, to his own residence:  of and concerning\nwhich, all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere in\nPentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in the\ndirections to the coachman.\n\nIn a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young\nwoman staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering\nwalk for a swift run, returned by the most devious and\ncomplicated route she could think of, to the domicile of the Jew.\n\nMr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition\ndelivered, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and,\nputting on his hat, expeditiously departed:  without devoting any\ntime to the formality of wishing the company good-morning.\n\n`We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,` said the\nJew greatly excited.  `Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till\nyou bring home some news of him!  Nancy, my dear, I must have him\nfound.  I trust to you, my dear,--to you and the Artful for\neverything!  Stay, stay,` added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with\na shaking hand; `there`s money, my dears.  I shall shut up this\nshop to-night.  You`ll know where to find me!  Don`t stop here a\nminute.  Not an instant, my dears!`\n\nWith these words, he pushed them from the room:  and carefully\ndouble-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its\nplace of concealment the box which he had unintentionally\ndisclosed to Oliver.  Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the\nwatches and jewellery beneath his clothing.\n\nA rap at the door startled him in this occupation.  `Who`s\nthere?` he cried in a shrill tone.\n\n`Me!` replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.\n\n`What now?` cried the Jew impatiently.\n\n`Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?` inquired\nthe Dodger.\n\n`Yes,` replied the Jew, `wherever she lays hands on him.  Find\nhim, find him out, that`s all.  I shall know what to do next;\nnever fear.`\n\nThe boy murmured a reply of intelligence:  and hurried downstairs\nafter his companions.\n\n`He has not peached so far,` said the Jew as he pursued his\noccupation.  `If he means to blab us among his new friends, we\nmay stop his mouth yet.`\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nCOMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER`S STAY AT MR.\nBROWNLOW`S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG\nUTTERED CONCERNING HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND\n\nOliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr.\nBrownlow`s abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the\npicture was carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs.\nBedwin, in the conversation that ensued:  which indeed bore no\nreference to Oliver`s history or prospects, but was confined to\nsuch topics as might amuse without exciting him.  He was still\ntoo weak to get up to breakfast; but, when he came down into the\nhousekeeper`s room next day, his first act was to cast an eager\nglance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of\nthe beautiful lady.  His expectations were disappointed, however,\nfor the picture had been removed.\n\n`Ah!` said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver`s\neyes.  `It is gone, you see.`\n\n`I see it is ma`am,` replied Oliver.  `Why have they taken it\naway?`\n\n`It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that\nas it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting\nwell, you know,` rejoined the old lady.\n\n`Oh, no, indeed.  It didn`t worry me, ma`am,` said Oliver. `I\nliked to see it.  I quite loved it.`\n\n`Well, well!` said the old lady, good-humouredly; `you get well\nas fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again.\nThere!  I promise you that!  Now, let us talk about something\nelse.`\n\nThis was all the information Oliver could obtain about the\npicture at that time.  As the old lady had been so kind to him in\nhis illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just\nthen; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told\nhim, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was\nmarried to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country;\nand about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies;\nand who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful\nletters home four times a-year, that it brought the tears into\nher eyes to talk about them.  When the old lady had expatiated, a\nlong time, on the excellences of her children, and the merits of\nher kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor\ndear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea.\nAfter tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as\nquickly as she could teach:  and at which game they played, with\ngreat interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to\nhave some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and\nthen to go cosily to bed.\n\nThey were happy days, those of Oliver`s recovery.  Everything was\nso quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle;\nthat after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had\nalways lived, it seemed like Heaven itself.  He was no sooner\nstrong enough to put his clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow\ncaused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of\nshoes, to be provided for him.  As Oliver was told that he might\ndo what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant\nwho had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a\nJew, and keep the money for herself.  This she very readily did;\nand, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew\nroll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to\nthink that they were safely gone, and that there was now no\npossible danger of his ever being able to wear them again.  They\nwere sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new\nsuit before.\n"}

{"text":"\nOne evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he\nwas sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down\nfrom Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he\nshould like to see him in his study, and talk to him a little\nwhile.\n\n`Bless us, and save us!  Wash your hands, and let me part your\nhair nicely for you, child,` said Mrs. Bedwin.  `Dear heart\nalive!  If we had known he would have asked for you, we would\nhave put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as\nsixpence!`\n\nOliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented\ngrievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the\nlittle frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so\ndelicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage,\nthat she went so far as to say:  looking at him with great\ncomplacency from head to foot, that she really didn`t think it\nwould have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made\nmuch difference in him for the better.\n\nThus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.  On Mr.\nBrownlow calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little\nback room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some\npleasant little gardens.  There was a table drawn up before the\nwindow, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading.  When he saw\nOliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told him to come\nnear the table, and sit down.  Oliver complied; marvelling where\nthe people could be found to read such a great number of books as\nseemed to be written to make the world wiser.  Which is still a\nmarvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of\ntheir lives.\n\n`There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?` said Mr.\nBrownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the\nshelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.\n\n`A great number, sir,` replied Oliver.  `I never saw so many.`\n\n`You shall read them, if you behave well,` said the old gentleman\nkindly; `and you will like that, better than looking at the\noutsides,--that is, some cases; because there are books of which\nthe backs and covers are by far the best parts.`\n\n`I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,` said Oliver, pointing\nto some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the\nbinding.\n\n`Not always those,` said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the\nhead, and smiling as he did so; `there are other equally heavy\nones, though of a much smaller size.  How should you like to grow\nup a clever man, and write books, eh?`\n\n`I think I would rather read them, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\n`What! wouldn`t you like to be a book-writer?` said the old\ngentleman.\n\nOliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should\nthink it would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon\nwhich the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had\nsaid a very good thing.  Which Oliver felt glad to have done,\nthough he by no means knew what it was.\n"}

At the earnest manner of his\nreply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about\na curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very\ngreat attention to.\n\n`Now,` said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but\nat the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had\never known him assume yet, `I want you to pay great attention, my\nboy, to what I am going to say.  I shall talk to you without any\nreserve; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as\nmany older persons would be.`\n\n`Oh, don`t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!`\nexclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old\ngentleman`s commencement!  `Don`t turn me out of doors to wander\nin the streets again.  Let me stay here, and be a servant.  Don`t\nsend me back to the wretched place I came from.  Have mercy upon\na poor boy, sir!`\n\n`My dear child,` said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of\nOliver`s sudden appeal; `you need not be afraid of my deserting\nyou, unless you give me cause.`\n\n`I never, never will, sir,` interposed Oliver.\n\n`I hope not,` rejoined the old gentleman.  `I do not think you\never will.  I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I\nhave endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to\ntrust you, nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf\nthan I can well account for, even to myself.  The persons on whom\nI have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but,\nalthough the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there\ntoo, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up,\nforever, on my best affections.  Deep affliction has but\nstrengthened and refined them.`\n\nAs the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself\nthan to his companion:  and as he remained silent for a short\ntime afterwards:  Oliver sat quite still.\n\n`Well, well!` said the old gentleman at length, in a more\ncheerful tone, `I only say this, because you have a young heart;\nand knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will\nbe more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again.  You say you are\nan orphan, without a friend in the world; all the inquiries I\nhave been able to make, confirm the statement.  Let me hear your\nstory; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got\ninto the company in which I found you.  Speak the truth, and you\nshall not be friendless while I live.`\n\nOliver`s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was\non the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at\nthe farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a\npeculiarly impatient little double-knock was heard at the\nstreet-door:  and the servant, running upstairs, announced Mr.\nGrimwig.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Is he coming up?` inquired Mr. Brownlow.\n\n`Yes, sir,` replied the servant.  `He asked if there were any\nmuffins in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had\ncome to tea.`\n\nMr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr.\nGrimwig was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being\na little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy creature at\nbottom, as he had reason to know.\n\n`Shall I go downstairs, sir?` inquired Oliver.\n\n`No,` replied Mr. Brownlow, `I would rather you remained here.`\n\nAt this moment, there walked into the room:  supporting himself\nby a thick stick:  a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg,\nwho was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen\nbreeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the\nsides turned up with green.  A very small-plaited shirt frill\nstuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long steel watch-chain,\nwith nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it.  The\nends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the\nsize of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his\ncountenance was twisted, defy description.  He had a manner of\nscrewing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out\nof the corners of his eyes at the same time:  which irresistibly\nreminded the beholder of a parrot.  In this attitude, he fixed\nhimself, the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a\nsmall piece of orange-peel at arm`s length, exclaimed, in a\ngrowling, discontented voice.\n\n`Look here! do you see this!  Isn`t it a most wonderful and\nextraordinary thing that I can`t call at a man`s house but I find\na piece of this poor surgeon`s friend on the staircase? I`ve been\nlamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my\ndeath, or I`ll be content to eat my own head, sir!`\n\nThis was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and\nconfirmed nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more\nsingular in his case, because, even admitting for the sake of\nargument, the possibility of scientific improvements being\nbrought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own\nhead in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig`s head\nwas such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man\nalive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through\nit at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very\nthick coating of powder.\n\n`I`ll eat my head, sir,` repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick\nupon the ground.  `Hallo! what`s that!` looking at Oliver, and\nretreating a pace or two.\n\n`This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,` said\nMr. Brownlow.\n\nOliver bowed.\n\n`You don`t mean to say that`s the boy who had the fever, I hope?`\nsaid Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more.  `Wait a minute!\nDon`t speak!  Stop--` continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all\ndread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery; `that`s the\nboy who had the orange!  If that`s not the boy, sir, who had the\norange, and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase, I`ll eat\nmy head, and his too.`\n\n`No, no, he has not had one,` said Mr. Brownlow, laughing.\n`Come!  Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`I feel strongly on this subject, sir,` said the irritable old\ngentleman, drawing off his gloves.  `There`s always more or less\norange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it`s put\nthere by the surgeon`s boy at the corner.  A young woman stumbled\nover a bit last night, and fell against my garden-railings;\ndirectly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp\nwith the pantomime-light.  `Don`t go to him,` I called out of the\nwindow, \"he`s an assassin!  A man-trap!\"  So he is.  If he is\nnot--`  Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on\nthe ground with his stick; which was always understood, by his\nfriends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it was not\nexpressed in words. Then, still keeping his stick in his hand, he\nsat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he wore attached\nto a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver:  who, seeing that\nhe was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.\n\n`That`s the boy, is it?` said Mr. Grimwig, at length.\n\n`That`s the boy,` replied Mr. Brownlow.\n\n`How are you, boy?` said Mr. Grimwig.\n\n`A great deal better, thank you, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\nMr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was\nabout to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step\ndownstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which,\nas he did not half like the visitor`s manner, he was very happy\nto do.\n\n`He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?` inquired Mr. Brownlow.\n\n`I don`t know,` replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.\n\n`Don`t know?`\n\n`No.  I don`t know.  I never see any difference in boys.  I only\nknew two sort of boys.  Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.`\n\n`And which is Oliver?`\n\n`Mealy.  I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy,\nthey call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring\neyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be\nswelling out of the seams of his blue clothes; with the voice of\na pilot, and the appetite of a wolf.  I know him!  The wretch!`\n\n`Come,` said Mr. Brownlow, `these are not the characteristics of\nyoung Oliver Twist; so he needn`t excite your wrath.`\n\n`They are not,` replied Mr. Grimwig.  `He may have worse.`\n\nHere, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford\nMr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight.\n\n`He may have worse, I say,` repeated Mr. Grimwig.  `Where does he\ncome from!  Who is he?  What is he?  He has had a fever.  What of\nthat?  Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they?  Bad\npeople have fevers sometimes; haven`t they, eh?  I knew a man who\nwas hung in Jamaica for murdering his master.  He had had a fever\nsix times; he wasn`t recommended to mercy on that account.  Pooh!\nnonsense!`\n\nNow, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart,\nMr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver`s\nappearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a\nstrong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by\nthe finding of the orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no\nman should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not,\nhe had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend.  When Mr.\nBrownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet\nreturn a satisfactory answer; and that he had postponed any\ninvestigation into Oliver`s previous history until he thought the\nboy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled\nmaliciously.  And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the\nhousekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night;\nbecause if she didn`t find a table-spoon or two missing some\nsunshiny morning, why, he would be content to--and so forth.\n\nAll this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous\ngentleman:  knowing his friend`s peculiarities, bore with great\ngood humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to\nexpress his entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very\nsmoothly; and Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel\nmore at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old\ngentleman`s presence.\n\n`And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular\naccount of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?` asked\nGrimwig of Mr. Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking\nsideways at Oliver, as he resumed his subject.\n"}

{"text":"\n`To-morrow morning,` replied Mr. Brownlow.  `I would rather he\nwas alone with me at the time.  Come up to me to-morrow morning\nat ten o`clock, my dear.`\n\n`Yes, sir,` replied Oliver.  He answered with some hesitation,\nbecause he was confused by Mr. Grimwig`s looking so hard at him.\n\n`I`ll tell you what,` whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow;\n`he won`t come up to you to-morrow morning.  I saw him hesitate.\nHe is deceiving you, my good friend.`\n\n`I`ll swear he is not,` replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.\n\n`If he is not,` said Mr. Grimwig, `I`ll--` and down went the\nstick.\n\n`I`ll answer for that boy`s truth with my life!` said Mr.\nBrownlow, knocking the table.\n\n`And I for his falsehood with my head!` rejoined Mr. Grimwig,\nknocking the table also.\n\n`We shall see,` said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.\n\n`We will,` replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile;  `we\nwill.`\n\nAs fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this\nmoment, a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that\nmorning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has\nalready figured in this history; having laid them on the table,\nshe prepared to leave the room.\n\n`Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!` said Mr. Brownlow; `there is\nsomething to go back.`\n\n`He has gone, sir,` replied Mrs. Bedwin.\n\n`Call after him,` said Mr. Brownlow; `it`s particular.  He is a\npoor man, and they are not paid for.  There are some books to be\ntaken back, too.`\n\nThe street-door was opened.  Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran\nanother; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the\nboy; but there was no boy in sight.  Oliver and the girl\nreturned, in a breathless state, to report that there were no\ntidings of him.\n\n`Dear me, I am very sorry for that,` exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; `I\nparticularly wished those books to be returned to-night.`\n\n`Send Oliver with them,` said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical\nsmile; `he will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.`\n\n`Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,` said Oliver.\n`I`ll run all the way, sir.`\n\nThe old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go\nout on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig\ndetermined him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge\nof the commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his\nsuspicions:  on this head at least:  at once.\n\n`You _shall_ go, my dear,` said the old gentleman.  `The books are\non a chair by my table.  Fetch them down.`\n\nOliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his\narm in a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what\nmessage he was to take.\n\n`You are to say,` said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at\nGrimwig; `you are to say that you have brought those books back;\nand that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him.  This\nis a five-pound note, so you will have to bring me back, ten\nshillings change.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`I won`t be ten minutes, sir,` said Oliver, eagerly.  Having\nbuttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the\nbooks carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left\nthe room.  Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street-door, giving\nhim many directions about the nearest way, and the name of the\nbookseller, and the name of the street:  all of which Oliver said\nhe clearly understood.  Having superadded many injunctions to be\nsure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him to\ndepart.\n\n`Bless his sweet face!` said the old lady, looking after him. `I\ncan`t bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.`\n\nAt this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he\nturned the corner.  The old lady smilingly returned his\nsalutation, and, closing the door, went back to her own room.\n\n`Let me see; he`ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,`\nsaid Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the\ntable.  `It will be dark by that time.`\n\n`Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?` inquired Mr.\nGrimwig.\n\n`Don`t you?` asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.\n\nThe spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig`s breast,\nat the moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend`s\nconfident smile.\n\n`No,` he said, smiting the table with his fist, `I do not. The\nboy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable\nbooks under his arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket.  He`ll\njoin his old friends the thieves, and laugh at you.  If ever that\nboy returns to this house, sir, I`ll eat my head.`\n\nWith these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there\nthe two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch\nbetween them.\n\nIt is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach\nto our own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our\nmost rash and hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was\nnot by any means a bad-hearted man, and though he would have been\nunfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived,\nhe really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment,\nthat Oliver Twist might not come back.\n\nIt grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely\ndiscernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in\nsilence, with the watch between them.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XV\n\nSHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS\nNANCY WERE\n\nIn the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest\npart of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a\nflaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no\nray of sun ever shone in the summer:  there sat, brooding over a\nlittle pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated\nwith the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts,\nhalf-boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no\nexperienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise\nas Mr. William Sikes.  At his feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed\ndog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master\nwith both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh\ncut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of\nsome recent conflict.\n\n`Keep quiet, you warmint!  Keep quiet!` said Mr. Sikes, suddenly\nbreaking silence.  Whether his meditations were so intense as to\nbe disturbed by the dog`s winking, or whether his feelings were\nso wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the\nrelief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay\nthem, is matter for argument and consideration.  Whatever was the\ncause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog\nsimultaneously.\n\nDogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon\nthem by their masters; but Mr. Sikes`s dog, having faults of\ntemper in common with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this\nmoment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at\nonce fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots.  Having given in a\nhearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping\nthe pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head.\n\n`You would, would you?` said Sikes, seizing the poker in one\nhand, and deliberately opening with the other a large\nclasp-knife, which he drew from his pocket.  `Come here, you born\ndevil!  Come here!  D`ye hear?`\n\nThe dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very\nharshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain\nsome unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he\nremained where he was, and growled more fiercely than before:  at\nthe same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth,\nand biting at it like a wild beast.\n\nThis resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping\non his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously.  The dog\njumped from right to left, and from left to right; snapping,\ngrowling, and barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and\nblasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point\nfor one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted\nout:  leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp-knife in\nhis hands.\n"}

{"text":"\nThere must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old\nadage.  Mr. Sikes, being disappointed of the dog`s participation,\nat once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.\n\n`What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?` said\nSikes, with a fierce gesture.\n\n`I didn`t know, my dear, I didn`t know,` replied Fagin, humbly;\nfor the Jew was the new comer.\n\n`Didn`t know, you white-livered thief!` growled Sikes. `Couldn`t\nyou hear the noise?`\n\n`Not a sound of it, as I`m a living man, Bill,` replied the Jew.\n\n`Oh no!  You hear nothing, you don`t,` retorted Sikes with a\nfierce sneer.  `Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you\ncome or go!  I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute\nago.`\n\n`Why?` inquired the Jew with a forced smile.\n\n`Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you,\nas haven`t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he\nlikes,` replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very\nexpressive look; `that`s why.`\n\nThe Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table,\naffected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend.  He was\nobviously very ill at ease, however.\n\n`Grin away,` said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him\nwith savage contempt; `grin away.  You`ll never have the laugh at\nme, though, unless it`s behind a nightcap.  I`ve got the upper\nhand over you, Fagin; and, d--me, I`ll keep it.  There!  If I go,\nyou go; so take care of me.`\n\n`Well, well, my dear,` said the Jew, `I know all that;\nwe--we--have a mutual interest, Bill,--a mutual interest.`\n\n`Humph,` said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more\non the Jew`s side than on his.  `Well, what have you got to say\nto me?`\n\n`It`s all passed safe through the melting-pot,` replied Fagin,\n`and this is your share.  It`s rather more than it ought to be,\nmy dear; but as I know you`ll do me a good turn another time,\nand--`\n\n`Stow that gammon,` interposed the robber, impatiently. `Where is\nit?  Hand over!`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,` replied the Jew,\nsoothingly.  `Here it is!  All safe!`  As he spoke, he drew forth\nan old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large\nknot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet.  Sikes,\nsnatching it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count\nthe sovereigns it contained.\n\n`This is all, is it?` inquired Sikes.\n\n`All,` replied the Jew.\n\n`You haven`t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you\ncome along, have you?` inquired Sikes, suspiciously. `Don`t put\non an injured look at the question; you`ve done it many a time.\nJerk the tinkler.`\n\nThese words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the\nbell.  It was answered by another Jew:  younger than Fagin, but\nnearly as vile and repulsive in appearance.\n\nBill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.  The Jew,\nperfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it:  previously\nexchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for\nan instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in\nreply; so slightly that the action would have been almost\nimperceptible to an observant third person.  It was lost upon\nSikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which\nthe dog had torn.  Possibly, if he had observed the brief\ninterchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no\ngood to him.\n\n`Is anybody here, Barney?` inquired Fagin; speaking, now that\nthat Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the\nground.\n\n`Dot a shoul,` replied Barney; whose words:  whether they came\nfrom the heart or not:  made their way through the nose.\n\n`Nobody?` inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise:  which perhaps\nmight mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.\n\n`Dobody but Biss Dadsy,` replied Barney.\n\n`Nancy!` exclaimed Sikes.  `Where?  Strike me blind, if I don`t\nhonour that `ere girl, for her native talents.`\n\n`She`s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,` replied\nBarney.\n\n`Send her here,` said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. `Send\nher here.`\n\nBarney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew\nremaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he\nretired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was\ndecorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key,\ncomplete.\n\n`You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?` inquired Sikes,\nproffering the glass.\n\n`Yes, I am, Bill,` replied the young lady, disposing of its\ncontents; `and tired enough of it I am, too.  The young brat`s\nbeen ill and confined to the crib; and--`\n\n`Ah, Nancy, dear!` said Fagin, looking up.\n\nNow, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew`s red eye-brows,\nand a half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that\nshe was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much\nimportance.  The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact\nis, that she suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious\nsmiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters.\nIn about ten minutes` time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of\ncoughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders,\nand declared it was time to go.  Mr. Sikes, finding that he was\nwalking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention\nof accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a\nlittle distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon\nas his master was out of sight.\n"}

{"text":"\nThe Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left\nit; looked after him as we walked up the dark passage; shook his\nclenched fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible\ngrin, reseated himself at the table; where he was soon deeply\nabsorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.\n\nMeanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so\nvery short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way\nto the book-stall.  When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently\nturned down a by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not\ndiscovering his mistake until he had got half-way down it, and\nknowing it must lead in the right direction, he did not think it\nworth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he\ncould, with the books under his arm.\n\nHe was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought\nto feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor\nlittle Dick, who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly\nat that very moment; when he was startled by a young woman\nscreaming out very loud.  `Oh, my dear brother!`  And he had\nhardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped\nby having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck.\n\n`Don`t,` cried Oliver, struggling.  `Let go of me.  Who is it?\nWhat are you stopping me for?`\n\nThe only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations\nfrom the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little\nbasket and a street-door key in her hand.\n\n`Oh my gracious!` said the young woman, `I have found him!  Oh!\nOliver!  Oliver!  Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such\ndistress on your account!  Come home, dear, come.  Oh, I`ve found\nhim.  Thank gracious goodness heavins, I`ve found him!`  With\nthese incoherent exclamations, the young woman burst into another\nfit of crying, and got so dreadfully hysterical, that a couple of\nwomen who came up at the moment asked a butcher`s boy with a\nshiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also looking on,\nwhether he didn`t think he had better run for the doctor.  To\nwhich, the butcher`s boy:  who appeared of a lounging, not to say\nindolent disposition:  replied, that he thought not.\n\n`Oh, no, no, never mind,` said the young woman, grasping Oliver`s\nhand; `I`m better now.  Come home directly, you cruel boy!\nCome!`\n\n`Oh, ma`am,` replied the young woman, `he ran away, near a month\nago, from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable\npeople; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters;\nand almost broke his mother`s heart.`\n\n`Young wretch!` said one woman.\n\n`Go home, do, you little brute,` said the other.\n\n`I am not,` replied Oliver, greatly alarmed.  `I don`t know her.\nI haven`t any sister, or father and mother either.  I`m an\norphan; I live at Pentonville.`\n\n`Only hear him, how he braves it out!` cried the young woman.\n\n`Why, it`s Nancy!` exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the\nfirst time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.\n\n`You see he knows me!` cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders.\n`He can`t help himself.  Make him come home, there`s good people,\nor he`ll kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!`\n\n`What the devil`s this?` said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop,\nwith a white dog at his heels; `young Oliver! Come home to your\npoor mother, you young dog!  Come home directly.`\n\n`I don`t belong to them.  I don`t know them.  Help! help!` cried\nOliver, struggling in the man`s powerful grasp.\n\n`Help!` repeated the man.  `Yes; I`ll help you, you young rascal!\n\nWhat books are these?  You`ve been a stealing `em, have you?\nGive `em here.`  With these words, the man tore the volumes from\nhis grasp, and struck him on the head.\n\n`That`s right!` cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. `That`s\nthe only way of bringing him to his senses!`\n\n`To be sure!` cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an\napproving look at the garret-window.\n\n`It`ll do him good!` said the two women.\n\n`And he shall have it, too!` rejoined the man, administering\nanother blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar.  `Come on, you\nyoung villain!  Here, Bull`s-eye, mind him, boy!  Mind him!`\n\nWeak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the\nsuddenness of the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the\ndog, and the brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction\nof the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch\nhe was described to be; what could one poor child do!  Darkness\nhad set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near;\nresistance was useless.  In another moment he was dragged into a\nlabyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a\npace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to,\nunintelligible.  It was of little moment, indeed, whether they\nwere intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them,\nhad they been ever so plain.\n\nThe gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at\nthe open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to\nsee if there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old\ngentlemen sat, perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch\nbetween them.\n\n"}

Sikes slackened his pace\nwhen they reached this spot:  the girl being quite unable to\nsupport any longer, the rapid rate at which they had hitherto\nwalked.  Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to take hold\nof Nancy`s hand.\n\n`Do you hear?` growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked\nround.\n\nThey were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.\n\nOliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no\navail.  He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.\n\n`Give me the other,` said Sikes, seizing Oliver`s unoccupied\nhand.  `Here, Bull`s-Eye!`\n\nThe dog looked up, and growled.\n\n`See here, boy!` said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver`s\nthroat; `if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him!  D`ye mind!`\n\nThe dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he\nwere anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.\n\n`He`s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn`t!`\nsaid Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and\nferocious approval.  `Now, you know what you`ve got to expect,\nmaster, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop\nthat game.  Get on, young`un!`\n\nBull`s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually\nendearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory\ngrowl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.\n\nIt was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have\nbeen Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary.\nThe night was dark and foggy.  The lights in the shops could\nscarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every\nmoment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering\nthe strange place still stranger in Oliver`s eyes; and making his\nuncertainty the more dismal and depressing.\n\nThey had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck\nthe hour.  With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and\nturned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.\n\n`Eight o` clock, Bill,` said Nancy, when the bell ceased.\n\n`What`s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can`t I!`\nreplied Sikes.\n\n`I wonder whether THEY can hear it,` said Nancy.\n\n`Of course they can,` replied Sikes.  `It was Bartlemy time when\nI was shopped; and there warn`t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I\ncouldn`t hear the squeaking on.  Arter I was locked up for the\nnight, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so\nsilent, that I could almost have beat my brains out against the\niron plates of the door.`\n"}

Well, they`re as good as dead, so it don`t much\nmatter.`\n\nWith this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising\ntendency to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver`s wrist more firmly,\ntold him to step out again.\n\n`Wait a minute!` said the girl:  `I wouldn`t hurry by, if it was\nyou that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o`clock\nstruck, Bill.  I`d walk round and round the place till I dropped,\nif the snow was on the ground, and I hadn`t a shawl to cover me.`\n\n`And what good would that do?` inquired the unsentimental Mr.\nSikes.  `Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of\ngood stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or\nnot walking at all, for all the good it would do me.  Come on,\nand don`t stand preaching there.`\n\nThe girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round\nher; and they walked away.  But Oliver felt her hand tremble,\nand, looking up in her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that\nit had turned a deadly white.\n\nThey walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full\nhalf-hour:  meeting very few people, and those appearing from\ntheir looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr.\nSikes himself.  At length they turned into a very filthy narrow\nstreet, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running\nforward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for\nhis keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was\nclosed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous\ncondition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it\nwas to let:  which looked as if it had hung there for many years.\n\n`All right,` cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.\n\nNancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a\nbell.  They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood\nfor a few moments under a lamp.  A noise, as if a sash window\nwere gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door\nsoftly opened.  Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the\ncollar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly\ninside the house.\n\nThe passage was perfectly dark.  They waited, while the person\nwho had let them in, chained and barred the door.\n\n`Anybody here?` inquired Sikes.\n\n`No,` replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.\n\n`Is the old `un here?` asked the robber.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Yes,` replied the voice, `and precious down in the mouth he has\nbeen.  Won`t he be glad to see you?  Oh, no!`\n\nThe style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,\nseemed familiar to Oliver`s ears:  but it was impossible to\ndistinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness.\n\n`Let`s have a glim,` said Sikes, `or we shall go breaking our\nnecks, or treading on the dog.  Look after your legs if you do!`\n\n`Stand still a moment, and I`ll get you one,` replied the voice.\nThe receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another\nminute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful\nDodger, appeared.  He bore in his right hand a tallow candle\nstuck in the end of a cleft stick.\n\nThe young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of\nrecognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away,\nbeckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs.\nThey crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low\nearthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small\nback-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.\n\n`Oh, my wig, my wig!` cried Master Charles Bates, from whose\nlungs the laughter had proceeded:  `here he is! oh, cry, here he\nis!  Oh, Fagin, look at him!  Fagin, do look at him! I can`t bear\nit; it is such a jolly game, I cant` bear it.  Hold me, somebody,\nwhile I laugh it out.`\n\nWith this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid\nhimself flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five\nminutes, in an ectasy of facetious joy.  Then jumping to his\nfeet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing\nto Oliver, viewed him round and round; while the Jew, taking off\nhis nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered\nboy.  The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine\ndisposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered\nwith business, rifled Oliver`s pockets with steady assiduity.\n\n`Look at his togs, Fagin!` said Charley, putting the light so\nclose to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire.  `Look at\nhis togs!  Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut!  Oh, my eye,\nwhat a game!  And his books, too!  Nothing but a gentleman,\nFagin!`\n\n`Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,` said the Jew,\nbowing with mock humility.  `The Artful shall give you another\nsuit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one.  Why\ndidn`t you write, my dear, and say you were coming?  We`d have\ngot something warm for supper.`\n\nAt his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself\nrelaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth\nthe five-pound note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the\nsally of the discovery awakened his merriment.\n\n`Hallo, what`s that?` inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew\nseized the note.  `That`s mine, Fagin.`\n"}

You shall\nhave the books.`\n\n`If that ain`t mine!` said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a\ndetermined air; `mine and Nancy`s that is; I`ll take the boy back\nagain.`\n\nThe Jew started.  Oliver started too, though from a very\ndifferent cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end\nin his being taken back.\n\n`Come!  Hand over, will you?` said Sikes.\n\n`This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?` inquired\nthe Jew.\n\n`Fair, or not fair,` retorted Sikes, `hand over, I tell you! Do\nyou think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our\nprecious time but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping,\nevery young boy as gets grabbed through you?  Give it here, you\navaricious old skeleton, give it here!`\n\nWith this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from\nbetween the Jew`s finger and thumb; and looking the old man\ncoolly in the face, folded it up small, and tied it in his\nneckerchief.\n\n`That`s for our share of the trouble,` said Sikes; `and not half\nenough, neither.  You may keep the books, if you`re fond of\nreading.  If you ain`t, sell `em.`\n\n`They`re very pretty,` said Charley Bates: who, with sundry\ngrimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in\nquestion; `beautiful writing, isn`t is, Oliver?`  At sight of the\ndismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master\nBates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell\ninto another ectasy, more boisterous than the first.\n\n`They belong to the old gentleman,` said Oliver, wringing his\nhands; `to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his\nhouse, and had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever.\nOh, pray send them back; send him back the books and money.  Keep\nme here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back.  He`ll\nthink I stole them; the old lady:  all of them who were so kind\nto me: will think I stole them.  Oh, do have mercy upon me, and\nsend them back!`\n\nWith these words, which were uttered with all the energy of\npassionate grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew`s feet;\nand beat his hands together, in perfect desperation.\n\n`The boy`s right,` remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and\nknitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot.  `You`re right,\nOliver, you`re right; they WILL think you have stolen `em.  Ha!\nha!` chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, `it couldn`t have\nhappened better, if we had chosen our time!`\n\n`Of course it couldn`t,` replied Sikes; `I know`d that, directly\nI see him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his\narm.  It`s all right enough.  They`re soft-hearted psalm-singers,\nor they wouldn`t have taken him in at all; and they`ll ask no\nquestions after him, fear they should be obliged to prosecute,\nand so get him lagged.  He`s safe enough.`\n"}

She flung it into the fire,\nwith a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out\ninto the room.\n\n`I won`t stand by and see it done, Fagin,` cried the girl.\n`You`ve got the boy, and what more would you have?--Let him\nbe--let him be--or I shall put that mark on some of you, that\nwill bring me to the gallows before my time.`\n\nThe girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented\nthis threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands\nclenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber:\nher face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she\nhad gradually worked herself.\n\n`Why, Nancy!` said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause,\nduring which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a\ndisconcerted manner; `you,--you`re more clever than ever\nto-night.  Ha! ha! my dear, you are acting beautifully.`\n\n`Am I!` said the girl.  `Take care I don`t overdo it.  You will\nbe the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good\ntime to keep clear of me.`\n\nThere is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to\nall her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of\nrecklessness and despair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew\nsaw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake\nregarding the reality of Miss Nancy`s rage; and, shrinking\ninvoluntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and\nhalf cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest\nperson to pursue the dialogue.\n\nMr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his\npersonal pride and influence interested in the immediate\nreduction of Miss Nancy to reason; gave utterance to about a\ncouple of score of curses and threats, the rapid production of\nwhich reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention.\nAs they produced no visible effect on the object against whom\nthey were discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible\narguments.\n\n`What do you mean by this?` said Sikes; backing the inquiry with\na very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human\nfeatures: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every\nfifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render\nblindness as common a disorder as measles: `what do you mean by\nit?  Burn my body!  Do you know who you are, and what you are?`\n\n`Oh, yes, I know all about it,` replied the girl, laughing\nhysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor\nassumption of indifference.\n\n`Well, then, keep quiet,` rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that\nhe was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, `or I`ll quiet\nyou for a good long time to come.`\n"}

A\npretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend\nof!`\n\n`God Almighty help me, I am!` cried the girl passionately; `and I\nwish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places\nwith them we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in\nbringing him here.

Charley, show Oliver to bed.`\n\n`I suppose he`d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin,\nhad he?` inquired Charley Bates.\n\n`Certainly not,` replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with\nwhich Charley put the question.\n\nMaster Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took\nthe cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where\nthere were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before;\nand here, with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he\nproduced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so\nmuch congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow`s;\nand the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who\npurchased them, had been the very first clue received, of his\nwhereabout.\n\n`Put off the smart ones,` said Charley, `and I`ll give `em to\nFagin to take care of.  What fun it is!`\n\nPoor Oliver unwillingly complied.  Master Bates rolling up the\nnew clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver\nin the dark, and locking the door behind him.\n\nThe noise of Charley`s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who\nopportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform\nother feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might\nhave kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than\nthose in which Oliver was placed.

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nOLIVER`S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO\nLONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION\n\nIt is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas,\nto present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular\nalternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky\nbacon.  The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by\nfetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his faithful but\nunconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song.  We\nbehold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a\nproud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in\ndanger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost\nof the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the\nhighest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway\ntransported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed\nseneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals,\nwho are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to\npalaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.\n\nSuch changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they\nwould seem at first sight.  The transitions in real life from\nwell-spread boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to\nholiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we\nare busy actors, instead of passive lookers-on, which makes a\nvast difference.  The actors in the mimic life of the theatre,\nare blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion\nor feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators,\nare at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.\n\nAs sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and\nplace, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by\nmany considered as the great art of authorship: an author`s skill\nin his craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with\nrelation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the\nend of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one\nmay perhaps be deemed unnecessary.  If so, let it be considered a\ndelicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going\nback to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader\ntaking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons\nfor making the journey, or he would not be invited to proceed\nupon such an expedition.\n\nMr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and\nwalked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High\nStreet.  He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his\ncocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched\nhis cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power.  Mr.\nBumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was\nhigher than usual.  There was an abstraction in his eye, an\nelevation in his air, which might have warned an observant\nstranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle`s mind, too\ngreat for utterance.\n\nMr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and\nothers who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along.  He\nmerely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and\nrelaxed not in his dignified pace, until he reached the farm\nwhere Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care.\n\n`Drat that beadle!` said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known\nshaking at the garden-gate.  `If it isn`t him at this time in the\nmorning!

{"text":"\n`I should like,` said the child, `to leave my dear love to poor\nOliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself\nand cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with\nnobody to help him.  And I should like to tell him,` said the\nchild pressing his small hands together, and speaking with great\nfervour, `that I was glad to die when I was very young; for,\nperhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown old, my little\nsister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me; and it\nwould be so much happier if we were both children there\ntogether.`\n\nMr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with\nindescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said,\n`They`re all in one story, Mrs. Mann.

Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to\nprepare for his journey.\n\nAt six o`clock next morning, Mr. Bumble:  having exchanged his\ncocked hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue\ngreat-coat with a cape to it:  took his place on the outside of\nthe coach, accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was\ndisputed; with whom, in due course of time, he arrived in London.\n\nHe experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which\noriginated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who\npersisted in shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner\nwhich, Mr. Bumble declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his\nhead, and made him feel quite uncomfortable; although he had a\ngreat-coat on.\n\nHaving disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr.\nBumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped;\nand took a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter.\nPutting a glass of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he\ndrew his chair to the fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on\nthe too-prevalent sin of discontent and complaining, composed\nhimself to read the paper.\n\nThe very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble`s eye rested, was\nthe following advertisement.\n\n                 `FIVE GUINEAS REWARD\n\n`Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was\nenticed, on Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville;\nand has not since been heard of.  The above reward will be paid\nto any person who will give such information as will lead to the\ndiscovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to throw any light\nupon his previous history, in which the advertiser is, for many\nreasons, warmly interested.`\n\nAnd then followed a full description of Oliver`s dress, person,\nappearance, and disappearance:  with the name and address of Mr.\nBrownlow at full length.\n\nMr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and\ncarefully, three several times; and in something more than five\nminutes was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his\nexcitement, left the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.\n\n`Is Mr. Brownlow at home?` inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who\nopened the door.\n\nTo this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather\nevasive reply of `I don`t know; where do you come from?`\n\nMr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver`s name, in explanation of his\nerrand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour\ndoor, hastened into the passage in a breathless state.\n\n`Come in, come in,` said the old lady: `I knew we should hear of\nhim.  Poor dear!  I knew we should!  I was certain of it.  Bless\nhis heart!  I said so all along.`\n"}

The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation:\n\n`A beadle.  A parish beadle, or I`ll eat my head.`\n\n`Pray don`t interrupt just now,` said Mr. Brownlow.  `Take a\nseat, will you?`\n\nMr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of\nMr. Grimwig`s manner.

A beadle all over!`\n\nMr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his\nfriend, and resumed:\n\n`Do you know where this poor boy is now?`\n\n`No more than nobody,` replied Mr. Bumble.\n\n`Well, what DO you know of him?` inquired the old gentleman.\n`Speak out, my friend, if you have anything to say.  What DO you\nknow of him?`\n\n`You don`t happen to know any good of him, do you?` said Mr.\nGrimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble`s\nfeatures.\n\nMr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head\nwith portentous solemnity.\n\n`You see?` said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr.\nBrownlow.\n\nMr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble`s pursed-up\ncountenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew\nregarding Oliver, in as few words as possible.\n\nMr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his\narms; inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a\nfew moments` reflection, commenced his story.\n\nIt would be tedious if given in the beadle`s words:  occupying,\nas it did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and\nsubstance of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and\nvicious parents.  That he had, from his birth, displayed no\nbetter qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice.  That\nhe had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by\nmaking a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad,\nand running away in the night-time from his master`s house.  In\nproof of his really being the person he represented himself, Mr.\nBumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town.\nFolding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow`s\nobservations.\n\n`I fear it is all too true,` said the old gentleman sorrowfully,\nafter looking over the papers.  `This is not much for your\nintelligence; but I would gladly have given you treble the money,\nif it had been favourable to the boy.`\n\nIt is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of\nthis information at an earlier period of the interview, he might\nhave imparted a very different colouring to his little history.\nIt was too late to do it now, however; so he shook his head\ngravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nHOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS\nREPUTABLE FRIENDS\n\nAbout noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone\nout to pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the\nopportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of\ningratitude; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty,\nto no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the\nsociety of his anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring\nto escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been\nincurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact\nof his having taken Oliver in, and cherished him, when, without\nhis timely aid, he might have perished with hunger; and he\nrelated the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in\nhis philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel circumstances,\nbut who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire\nto communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be\nhanged at the Old Bailey one morning.  Mr. Fagin did not seek to\nconceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in\nhis eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the\nyoung person in question, had rendered it necessary that he\nshould become the victim of certain evidence for the crown:\nwhich, if it were not precisely true, was indispensably necessary\nfor the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few select friends.  Mr.\nFagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the\ndiscomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and\npoliteness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might\nnever be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant\noperation.\n\nLittle Oliver`s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew`s\nwords, and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in\nthem.  That it was possible even for justice itself to confound\nthe innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental\ncompanionship, he knew already; and that deeply-laid plans for\nthe destruction of inconveniently knowing or over-communicative\npersons, had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on\nmore occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely, when he\nrecollected the general nature of the altercations between that\ngentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some\nforegone conspiracy of the kind.  As he glanced timidly up, and\nmet the Jew`s searching look, he felt that his pale face and\ntrembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that\nwary old gentleman.\n\nThe Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said,\nthat if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business,\nhe saw they would be very good friends yet.  Then, taking his\nhat, and covering himself with an old patched great-coat, he went\nout, and locked the room-door behind him.\n\nAnd so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of\nmany subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and\nmidnight, and left during the long hours to commune with his own\nthoughts.  Which, never failing to revert to his kind friends,\nand the opinion they must long ago have formed of him, were sad\nindeed.\n\nAfter the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door\nunlocked; and he was at liberty to wander about the house.\n\nIt was a very dirty place.  The rooms upstairs had great high\nwooden chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and\ncornices to the ceiling; which, although they were black with\nneglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways.  From all of\nthese tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago, before the\nold Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had\nperhaps been quite gay and handsome:  dismal and dreary as it\nlooked now.\n\nSpiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and\nceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room,\nthe mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified\nto their holes.  With these exceptions, there was neither sight\nnor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and\nhe was tired of wandering from room to room, he would crouch in\nthe corner of the passage by the street-door, to be as near\nliving people as he could; and would remain there, listening and\ncounting the hours, until the Jew or the boys returned.\n\nIn all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed:  the\nbars which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only\nlight which was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at\nthe top: which made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with\nstrange shadows.  There was a back-garret window with rusty bars\noutside, which had no shutter; and out of this, Oliver often\ngazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was\nto be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of\nhousetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.  Sometimes,\nindeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the\nparapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn\nagain; and as the window of Oliver`s observatory was nailed down,\nand dimmed with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he\ncould do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond,\nwithout making any attempt to be seen or heard,--which he had as\nmuch chance of being, as if he had lived inside the ball of St.\nPaul`s Cathedral.\n"}

{"text":"\nOne afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that\nevening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to\nevince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do\nhim justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him);\nand, with this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver\nto assist him in his toilet, straightway.\n\nOliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have\nsome faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate\nthose about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any\nobjection in the way of this proposal.  So he at once expressed\nhis readiness; and, kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat\nupon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps, he\napplied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as\n`japanning his trotter-cases.`  The phrase, rendered into plain\nEnglish, signifieth, cleaning his boots.\n\nWhether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a\nrational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table\nin an easy attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly\nto and fro, and having his boots cleaned all the time, without\neven the past trouble of having taken them off, or the\nprospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his\nreflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that\nsoothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer\nthat mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the\nnonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his\ngeneral nature.  He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful\ncountenance, for a brief space; and then, raising his head, and\nheaving a gentle sign, said, half in abstraction, and half to\nMaster Bates:\n\n`What a pity it is he isn`t a prig!`\n\n`Ah!` said Master Charles Bates; `he don`t know what`s good for\nhim.`\n\nThe Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley\nBates.  They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.\n\n`I suppose you don`t even know what a prig is?` said the Dodger\nmournfully.\n\n`I think I know that,` replied Oliver, looking up.  `It`s a\nthe--; you`re one, are you not?` inquired Oliver, checking\nhimself.\n\n`I am,` replied the Doger.  `I`d scorn to be anything else.`  Mr.\nDawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this\nsentiment, and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he\nwould feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary.\n\n`I am,` repeated the Dodger.  `So`s Charley.  So`s Fagin. So`s\nSikes.  So`s Nancy.  So`s Bet.  So we all are, down to the dog.\nAnd he`s the downiest one of the lot!`\n\n`And the least given to peaching,` added Charley Bates.\n\n`He wouldn`t so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of\ncommitting himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left\nhim there without wittles for a fortnight,` said the Dodger.\n\n`Not a bit of it,` observed Charley.\n\n`He`s a rum dog.  Don`t he look fierce at any strange cove that\nlaughs or sings when he`s in company!` pursued the Dodger.\n`Won`t he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing!  And\ndon`t he hate other dogs as ain`t of his breed!  Oh, no!`\n\n`He`s an out-and-out Christian,` said Charley.\n\nThis was merely intended as a tribute to the animal`s abilities,\nbut it was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master\nBates had only known it; for there are a good many ladies and\ngentlemen, claiming to be out-and-out Christians, between whom,\nand Mr. Sikes` dog, there exist strong and singular points of\nresemblance.\n\n`Well, well,` said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which\nthey had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which\ninfluenced all his proceedings.  `This hasn`t go anything to do\nwith young Green here.`\n\n`No more it has,` said Charley.  `Why don`t you put yourself\nunder Fagin, Oliver?`\n"}

I--I--would rather go.`\n\n`And Fagin would RATHER not!` rejoined Charley.\n\nOliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to\nexpress his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on\nwith his boot-cleaning.\n\n`Go!` exclaimed the Dodger.  `Why, where`s your spirit?` Don`t\nyou take any pride out of yourself?  Would you go and be\ndependent on your friends?`\n\n`Oh, blow that!` said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk\nhandkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard,\n`that`s too mean; that is.`\n\n`_I_ couldn`t do it,` said the Dodger, with an air of haughty\ndisgust.\n\n`You can leave your friends, though,` said Oliver with a half\nsmile; `and let them be punished for what you did.`\n\n`That,` rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, `That was\nall out of consideration for Fagin, `cause the traps know that we\nwork together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn`t\nmade our lucky; that was the move, wasn`t it, Charley?`\n\nMaster Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the\nrecollection of Oliver`s flight came so suddenly upon him, that\nthe smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up\ninto his head, and down into his throat: and brought on a fit of\ncoughing and stamping, about five minutes long.\n\n`Look here!` said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of\nshillings and halfpence. `Here`s a jolly life!  What`s the odds\nwhere it comes from?  Here, catch hold; there`s plenty more where\nthey were took from.  You won`t, won`t you?

As he said it,\nMaster Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it\nerect in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a\ncurious sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively\npantomimic representation, that scragging and hanging were one\nand the same thing.\n\n`That`s what it means,` said Charley.  `Look how he stares, Jack!\n\nI never did see such prime company as that `ere boy; he`ll be the\ndeath of me, I know he will.`  Master Charley Bates, having\nlaughed heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.\n\n`You`ve been brought up bad,` said the Dodger, surveying his\nboots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them.\n`Fagin will make something of you, though, or you`ll be the first\nhe ever had that turned out unprofitable.  You`d better begin at\nonce; for you`ll come to the trade long before you think of it;\nand you`re only losing time, Oliver.`\n"}

{"text":"\nMaster Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of\nhis own:  which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins\nlaunched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures\nincidental to the life they led, interspersed with a variety of\nhints to Oliver that the best thing he could do, would be to\nsecure Fagin`s favour without more delay, by the means which they\nthemselves had employed to gain it.\n\n`And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,` said the Dodger, as\nthe Jew was heard unlocking the door above, `if you don`t take\nfogels and tickers--`\n\n`What`s the good of talking in that way?` interposed Master\nBates; `he don`t know what you mean.`\n\n`If you don`t take pocket-handkechers and watches,` said the\nDodger, reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver`s\ncapacity, `some other cove will; so that the coves that lose `em\nwill be all the worse, and you`ll be all the worse, too, and\nnobody half a ha`p`orth the better, except the chaps wot gets\nthem--and you`ve just as good a right to them as they have.`\n\n`To be sure, to be sure!` said the Jew, who had entered unseen by\nOliver.  `It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take\nthe Dodger`s word for it.

He had small\ntwinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark\ncorduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron.  His\nwardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he excused\nhimself to the company by stating that his `time` was only out an\nhour before; and that, in consequence of having worn the\nregimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow\nany attention on his private clothes.  Mr. Chitling added, with\nstrong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating\nclothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt\nholes in them, and there was no remedy against the County.  The\nsame remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of\ncutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful.  Mr.\nChitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not\ntouched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long hard-working\ndays; and that he `wished he might be busted if he warn`t as dry\nas a lime-basket.`\n\n`Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?`\ninquired the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of\nspirits on the table.\n\n`I--I--don`t know, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\n`Who`s that?` inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look\nat Oliver.\n\n`A young friend of mine, my dear,` replied the Jew.\n\n`He`s in luck, then,` said the young man, with a meaning look at\nFagin.  `Never mind where I came from, young `un; you`ll find\nyour way there, soon enough, I`ll bet a crown!`\n\nAt this sally, the boys laughed.

At other times the\nold man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in\nhis younger days:  mixed up with so much that was droll and\ncurious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and\nshowing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings.\n\nIn short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils.  Having\nprepared his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society\nto the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary\nplace, he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison\nwhich he hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nIN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON\n\nIt was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his\ngreat-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the\ncollar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower\npart of his face:  emerged from his den.  He paused on the step\nas the door was locked and chained behind him; and having\nlistened while the boys made all secure, and until their\nretreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the\nstreet as quickly as he could.\n\nThe house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the\nneighborhood of Whitechapel.  The Jew stopped for an instant at\nthe corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round,\ncrossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the\nSpitalfields.\n\nThe mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the\nstreets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold\nand clammy to the touch.  It seemed just the night when it\nbefitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad.  As he glided\nstealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and\ndoorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile,\nengendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved:\ncrawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a\nmeal.\n\nHe kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways,\nuntil he reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the\nleft, he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty\nstreets which abound in that close and densely-populated quarter.\n\nThe Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed\nto be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or\nthe intricacies of the way.  He hurried through several alleys\nand streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a\nsingle lamp at the farther end.  At the door of a house in this\nstreet, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with\nthe person who opened it, he walked upstairs.\n\nA dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a\nman`s voice demanded who was there.\n\n`Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,` said the Jew looking in.\n\n`Bring in your body then,` said Sikes.  `Lie down, you stupid\nbrute!  Don`t you know the devil when he`s got a great-coat on?`\n\nApparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin`s\nouter garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over\nthe back of a chair, he retired to the corner from which he had\nrisen:  wagging his tail as he went, to show that he was as well\nsatisfied as it was in his nature to be.\n\n`Well!` said Sikes.\n\n`Well, my dear,` replied the Jew.--`Ah! Nancy.`\n\nThe latter recognition was uttered with just enough of\nembarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin\nand his young friend had not met, since she had interfered in\nbehalf of Oliver.  All doubts upon the subject, if he had any,\nwere speedily removed by the young lady`s behaviour.  She took\nher feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin\ndraw up his, without saying more about it:  for it was a cold\nnight, and no mistake.\n\n`It is cold, Nancy dear,` said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny\nhands over the fire.  `It seems to go right through one,` added\nthe old man, touching his side.\n\n`It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,`\nsaid Mr. Sikes.  `Give him something to drink, Nancy.  Burn my\nbody, make haste!  It`s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean\nold carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose\nfrom the grave.`\n\nNancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there\nwere many:  which, to judge from the diversity of their\nappearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids.  Sikes\npouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.\n\n`Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,` replied the Jew, putting\ndown the glass after just setting his lips to it.\n\n`What!  You`re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?`\ninquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew.  `Ugh!`\n\nWith a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and\nthrew the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a\npreparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself:  which he\ndid at once.\n\nThe Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the\nsecond glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often\nbefore; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him.\nIt was a meanly furnished apartment, with nothing but the\ncontents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was\nanything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles\ndisplayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood\nin a corner, and a `life-preserver` that hung over the\nchimney-piece.\n\n`There,` said Sikes, smacking his lips. `Now I`m ready.`\n\n`For business?` inquired the Jew.\n\n`For business,` replied Sikes; `so say what you`ve got to say.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?` said the Jew, drawing his\nchair forward, and speaking in a very low voice.\n\n`Yes.  Wot about it?` inquired Sikes.\n\n`Ah! you know what I mean, my dear,` said the Jew.  `He knows\nwhat I mean, Nancy; don`t he?`\n\n`No, he don`t,` sneered Mr. Sikes.  `Or he won`t, and that`s the\nsame thing.  Speak out, and call things by their right names;\ndon`t sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in\nhints, as if you warn`t the very first that thought about the\nrobbery.  Wot d`ye mean?`\n\n`Hush, Bill, hush!` said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to\nstop this burst of indignation; `somebody will hear us, my dear.\nSomebody will hear us.`\n\n`Let `em hear!` said Sikes; `I don`t care.`  But as Mr. Sikes DID\ncare, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words,\nand grew calmer.\n\n`There, there,` said the Jew, coaxingly.  `It was only my\ncaution, nothing more.  Now, my dear, about that crib at\nChertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh?  When is it to be\ndone?  Such plate, my dear, such plate!` said the Jew:  rubbing\nhis hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of\nanticipation.\n\n`Not at all,` replied Sikes coldly.\n\n`Not to be done at all!` echoed the Jew, leaning back in his\nchair.\n\n`No, not at all,` rejoined Sikes.  `At least it can`t be a put-up\njob, as we expected.`\n\n`Then it hasn`t been properly gone about,` said the Jew, turning\npale with anger.  `Don`t tell me!`\n\n`But I will tell you,` retorted Sikes.  `Who are you that`s not\nto be told?  I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about\nthe place for a fortnight, and he can`t get one of the servants\nin line.`\n\n`Do you mean to tell me, Bill,` said the Jew: softening as the\nother grew heated:  `that neither of the two men in the house can\nbe got over?`\n\n`Yes, I do mean to tell you so,` replied Sikes.  `The old lady\nhas had `em these twenty years; and if you were to give `em five\nhundred pound, they wouldn`t be in it.`\n\n`But do you mean to say, my dear,` remonstrated the Jew, `that\nthe women can`t be got over?`\n\n`Not a bit of it,` replied Sikes.\n\n`Not by flash Toby Crackit?` said the Jew incredulously. `Think\nwhat women are, Bill,`\n\n`No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,` replied Sikes.  `He says\nhe`s worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole\nblessed time he`s been loitering down there, and it`s all of no\nuse.`\n\n`He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers,\nmy dear,` said the Jew.\n\n`So he did,` rejoined Sikes, `and they warn`t of no more use than\nthe other plant.`\n\nThe Jew looked blank at this information.  After ruminating for\nsome minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head\nand said, with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported\naright, he feared the game was up.\n\n`And yet,` said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees,\n`it`s a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our\nhearts upon it.`\n\n`So it is,` said Mr. Sikes.  `Worse luck!`\n\nA long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep\nthought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy\nperfectly demoniacal.  Sikes eyed him furtively from time to\ntime.  Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker,\nsat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to\nall that passed.\n\n`Fagin,` said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that\nprevailed; `is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it`s safely done\nfrom the outside?`\n\n`Yes,` said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.\n\n`Is it a bargain?` inquired Sikes.\n\n`Yes, my dear, yes,` rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and\nevery muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the\ninquiry had awakened.\n\n`Then,` said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew`s hand, with some\ndisdain, `let it come off as soon as you like.  Toby and me were\nover the garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of\nthe door and shutters.  The crib`s barred up at night like a\njail; but there`s one part we can crack, safe and softly.`\n\n`Which is that, Bill?` asked the Jew eagerly.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Why,` whispered Sikes, `as you cross the lawn--`\n\n`Yes?` said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes\nalmost starting out of it.\n\n`Umph!` cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving\nher head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to\nthe Jew`s face.  `Never mind which part it is. You can`t do it\nwithout me, I know; but it`s best to be on the safe side when one\ndeals with you.`\n\n`As you like, my dear, as you like` replied the Jew.  `Is there\nno help wanted, but yours and Toby`s?`\n\n`None,` said Sikes.  `Cept a centre-bit and a boy.  The first\nwe`ve both got; the second you must find us.`\n\n`A boy!` exclaimed the Jew.  `Oh! then it`s a panel, eh?`\n\n`Never mind wot it is!` replied Sikes.  `I want a boy, and he\nmusn`t be a big `un.  Lord!` said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, `if\nI`d only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper`s!  He\nkept him small on purpose, and let him out by the job.  But the\nfather gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society\ncomes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning\nmoney, teaches him to read and write, and in time makes a\n`prentice of him.  And so they go on,` said Mr. Sikes, his wrath\nrising with the recollection of his wrongs, `so they go on; and,\nif they`d got money enough (which it`s a Providence they\nhaven`t,) we shouldn`t have half a dozen boys left in the whole\ntrade, in a year or two.`\n\n`No more we should,` acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering\nduring this speech, and had only caught the last sentence.\n`Bill!`\n\n`What now?` inquired Sikes.\n\nThe Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at\nthe fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told\nto leave the room.  Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as\nif he thought the precaution unnecessary; but complied,\nnevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of\nbeer.\n\n`You don`t want any beer,` said Nancy, folding her arms, and\nretaining her seat very composedly.\n\n`I tell you I do!` replied Sikes.\n\n`Nonsense,` rejoined the girl coolly, `Go on, Fagin.  I know what\nhe`s going to say, Bill; he needn`t mind me.`\n\nThe Jew still hesitated.  Sikes looked from one to the other in\nsome surprise.\n\n`Why, you don`t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?` he asked at\nlength.  `You`ve known her long enough to trust her, or the\nDevil`s in it.  She ain`t one to blab.  Are you Nancy?`\n\n`_I_ should think not!` replied the young lady:  drawing her\nchair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.\n\n`No, no, my dear, I know you`re not,` said the Jew; `but--` and\nagain the old man paused.\n\n`But wot?` inquired Sikes.\n\n`I didn`t know whether she mightn`t p`r`aps be out of sorts, you\nknow, my dear, as she was the other night,` replied the Jew.\n\nAt this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and,\nswallowing a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of\ndefiance, and burst into sundry exclamations of `Keep the game\na-going!`  `Never say die!` and the like.  These seemed to have\nthe effect of re-assuring both gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his\nhead with a satisfied air, and resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes\nlikewise.\n\n`Now, Fagin,` said Nancy with a laugh.  `Tell Bill at once, about\nOliver!`\n\n`Ha! you`re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!`\nsaid the Jew, patting her on the neck.  `It WAS about Oliver I\nwas going to speak, sure enough.  Ha! ha! ha!`\n\n`What about him?` demanded Sikes.\n\n`He`s the boy for you, my dear,` replied the Jew in a hoarse\nwhisper; laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning\nfrightfully.\n\n`He!` exclaimed. Sikes.\n\n`Have him, Bill!` said Nancy.  `I would, if I was in your place.\nHe mayn`t be so much up, as any of the others; but that`s not\nwhat you want, if he`s only to open a door for you.  Depend upon\nit he`s a safe one, Bill.`\n\n`I know he is,` rejoined Fagin.  `He`s been in good training\nthese last few weeks, and it`s time he began to work for his\nbread.  Besides, the others are all too big.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Well, he is just the size I want,` said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.\n\n`And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,` interposed the\nJew; `he can`t help himself.  That is, if you frighten him\nenough.`\n\n`Frighten him!` echoed Sikes.  `It`ll be no sham frightening,\nmind you.  If there`s anything queer about him when we once get\ninto the work; in for a penny, in for a pound.  You won`t see him\nalive again, Fagin.  Think of that, before you send him.  Mark my\nwords!` said the robber, poising a crowbar, which he had drawn\nfrom under the bedstead.\n\n`I`ve thought of it all,` said the Jew with energy. `I`ve--I`ve\nhad my eye upon him, my dears, close--close. Once let him feel\nthat he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he\nhas been a thief; and he`s ours!  Ours for his life.  Oho!  It\ncouldn`t have come about better!  The old man crossed his arms\nupon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap,\nliterally hugged himself for joy.\n\n`Ours!` said Sikes.  `Yours, you mean.`\n\n`Perhaps I do, my dear,` said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle.\n`Mine, if you like, Bill.`\n\n`And wot,` said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend,\n`wot makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when\nyou know there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every\nnight, as you might pick and choose from?`\n\n`Because they`re of no use to me, my dear,` replied the Jew, with\nsome confusion, `not worth the taking.  Their looks convict `em\nwhen they get into trouble, and I lose `em all.  With this boy,\nproperly managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn`t with\ntwenty of them.  Besides,` said the Jew, recovering his\nself-possession, `he has us now if he could only give us leg-bail\nagain; and he must be in the same boat with us.  Never mind how\nhe came there; it`s quite enough for my power over him that he\nwas in a robbery; that`s all I want.  Now, how much better this\nis, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the\nway--which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.`\n\n`When is it to be done?` asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent\nexclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust\nwith which he received Fagin`s affectation of humanity.\n\n`Ah, to be sure,` said the Jew; `when is it to be done, Bill?`\n\n`I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,` rejoined Sikes\nin a surly voice, `if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.`\n\n`Good,` said the Jew; `there`s no moon.`\n\n`No,` rejoined Sikes.\n\n`It`s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?` asked the\nJew.\n"}

Then you hold your tongue, and keep the melting-pot\nready, and that`s all you`ll have to do.`\n\nAfter some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it\nwas decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew`s next evening\nwhen the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin\ncraftily observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the\ntask, he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so\nrecently interfered in his behalf, than anybody else.  It was\nalso solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should, for the purposes\nof the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly consigned to the\ncare and custody of Mr. William Sikes; and further, that the said\nSikes should deal with him as he thought fit; and should not be\nheld responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might\nbe necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to render\nthe compact in this respect binding, any representations made by\nMr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and\ncorroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of\nflash Toby Crackit.\n\nThese preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy\nat a furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming\nmanner; yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches\nof song, mingled with wild execrations.  At length, in a fit of\nprofessional enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of\nhousebreaking tools:  which he had no sooner stumbled in with,\nand opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and\nproperties of the various implements it contained, and the\npeculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell over the\nbox upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.\n\n`Good-night, Nancy,` said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.\n\n`Good-night.`\n\nTheir eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly.  There was\nno flinching about the girl.

WILLIAM SIKES\n\nWhen Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to\nfind that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been\nplaced at his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed.\nAt first, he was pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might\nbe the forerunner of his release; but such thoughts were quickly\ndispelled, on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew,\nwho told him, in a tone and manner which increased his alarm,\nthat he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that\nnight.\n\n`To--to--stop there, sir?` asked Oliver, anxiously.\n\n`No, no, my dear.  Not to stop there,` replied the Jew.  `We\nshouldn`t like to lose you.  Don`t be afraid, Oliver, you shall\ncome back to us again.  Ha! ha! ha!  We won`t be so cruel as to\nsend you away, my dear.  Oh no, no!`\n\nThe old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of\nbread, looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as\nif to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away\nif he could.\n\n`I suppose,` said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, `you want\nto know what you`re going to Bill`s for---eh, my dear?`\n\nOliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had\nbeen reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to\nknow.\n\n`Why, do you think?` inquired Fagin, parrying the question.\n\n`Indeed I don`t know, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\n`Bah!` said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance\nfrom a close perusal of the boy`s face.  `Wait till Bill tells\nyou, then.`\n\nThe Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver`s not expressing any greater\ncuriosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver\nfelt very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest\ncunning of Fagin`s looks, and his own speculations, to make any\nfurther inquiries just then.  He had no other opportunity:  for\nthe Jew remained very surly and silent till night:  when he\nprepared to go abroad.\n\n`You may burn a candle,` said the Jew, putting one upon the\ntable.  `And here`s a book for you to read, till they come to\nfetch you.  Good-night!`\n\n`Good-night!` replied Oliver, softly.\n\nThe Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy\nas he went.  Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.\n\nOliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him\nto light it.  He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon\nthe table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with\nlowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of the room.\n\n`Take heed, Oliver! take heed!` said the old man, shaking his\nright hand before him in a warning manner.  `He`s a rough man,\nand thinks nothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls\nout, say nothing; and do what he bids you.  Mind!`  Placing a\nstrong emphasis on the last word, he suffered his features\ngradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and, nodding\nhis head, left the room.\n\nOliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man\ndisappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words\nhe had just heard.  The more he thought of the Jew`s admonition,\nthe more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning.\n\nHe could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to\nSikes, which would not be equally well answered by his remaining\nwith Fagin; and after meditating for a long time, concluded that\nhe had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for\nthe housebreaker, until another boy, better suited for his\npurpose could be engaged.  He was too well accustomed to\nsuffering, and had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the\nprospect of change very severely.  He remained lost in thought\nfor some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the\ncandle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him,\nbegan to read.\n"}

It was a history of the lives and trials of\ngreat criminals; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use.\nHere, he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of\nsecret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of\nbodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which\nwould not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them\nup at last, after many years, and so maddened the murderers with\nthe sight, that in their horror they had confessed their guilt,\nand yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.  Here, too, he read\nof men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had been\ntempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to\nsuch dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs\nquail, to think of.  The terrible descriptions were so real and\nvivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and\nthe words upon them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were\nwhispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.\n\nIn a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it\nfrom him.  Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to\nspare him from such deeds; and rather to will that he should die\nat once, than be reserved for crimes, so fearful and appalling.\nBy degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken\nvoice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and\nthat if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who\nhad never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to\nhim now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst\nof wickedness and guilt.\n\nHe had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head\nburied in his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.\n\n`What`s that!` he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a\nfigure standing by the door.  `Who`s there?`\n\n`Me.  Only me,` replied a tremulous voice.\n\nOliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the\ndoor.  It was Nancy.\n\n`Put down the light,` said the girl, turning away her head. `It\nhurts my eyes.`\n\nOliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she\nwere ill.  The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back\ntowards him:  and wrung her hands; but made no reply.\n\n`God forgive me!` she cried after a while, `I never thought of\nthis.`\n\n`Has anything happened?` asked Oliver.  `Can I help you?  I will\nif I can.  I will, indeed.`\n\nShe rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a\ngurgling sound, gasped for breath.\n\n`Nancy!` cried Oliver, `What is it?`\n\nThe girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the\nground; and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her:\nand shivered with cold.\n\nOliver stirred the fire.  Drawing her chair close to it, she sat\nthere, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she\nraised her head, and looked round.\n\n`I don`t know what comes over me sometimes,` said she, affecting\nto busy herself in arranging her dress; `it`s this damp dirty\nroom, I think.  Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?`\n\n`Am I to go with you?` asked Oliver.\n\n`Yes.  I have come from Bill,` replied the girl.  `You are to go\nwith me.`\n\n`What for?` asked Oliver, recoiling.\n\n`What for?` echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them\nagain, the moment they encountered the boy`s face.  `Oh!  For no\nharm.`\n\n`I don`t believe it,` said Oliver:  who had watched her closely.\n\n`Have it your own way,` rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh.\n`For no good, then.`\n\nOliver could see that he had some power over the girl`s better\nfeelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her\ncompassion for his helpless state.  But, then, the thought darted\nacross his mind that it was barely eleven o`clock; and that many\npeople were still in the streets:  of whom surely some might be\nfound to give credence to his tale.  As the reflection occured to\nhim, he stepped forward:  and said, somewhat hastily, that he was\nready.\n\nNeither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his\ncompanion.  She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon\nhim a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she\nguessed what had been passing in his thoughts.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Hush!` said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the\ndoor as she looked cautiously round.  `You can`t help yourself. I\nhave tried hard for you, but all to no purpose.  You are hedged\nround and round.  If ever you are to get loose from here, this is\nnot the time.`\n\nStruck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face\nwith great surprise.  She seemed to speak the truth; her\ncountenance was white and agitated; and she trembled with very\nearnestness.\n\n`I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and\nI do now,` continued the girl aloud; `for those who would have\nfetched you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than\nme.  I have promised for your being quiet and silent; if you are\nnot, you will only do harm to yourself and me too, and perhaps be\nmy death.  See here!  I have borne all this for you already, as\ntrue as God sees me show it.`\n\nShe pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms;\nand continued, with great rapidity:\n\n`Remember this!  And don`t let me suffer more for you, just now.\nIf I could help you, I would; but I have not the power.  They\ndon`t mean to harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of\nyours.  Hush!  Every word from you is a blow for me.  Give me\nyour hand.  Make haste!  Your hand!`\n\nShe caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers,\nand, blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The\ndoor was opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness,\nand was as quickly closed, when they had passed out.  A\nhackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which\nshe had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl pulled him in\nwith her, and drew the curtains close.  The driver wanted no\ndirections, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the\ndelay of an instant.\n\nThe girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to\npour into his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already\nimparted.  All was so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely\ntime to recollect where he was, or how he came there, when the\ncarriage stopped at the house to which the Jew`s steps had been\ndirected on the previous evening.\n\nFor one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the\nempty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips.  But the\ngirl`s voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of\nagony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it.\nWhile he hesitated, the opportunity was gone; he was already in\nthe house, and the door was shut.\n\n`This way,` said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time.\n`Bill!`\n\n`Hallo!` replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with\na candle.  `Oh!  That`s the time of day.  Come on!`\n\nThis was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly\nhearty welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes` temperament.  Nancy,\nappearing much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.\n\n`Bull`s-eye`s gone home with Tom,` observed Sikes, as he lighted\nthem up.  `He`d have been in the way.`\n\n`That`s right,` rejoined Nancy.\n\n`So you`ve got the kid,` said Sikes when they had all reached the\nroom: closing the door as he spoke.\n\n`Yes, here he is,` replied Nancy.\n\n`Did he come quiet?` inquired Sikes.\n\n`Like a lamb,` rejoined Nancy.\n\n`I`m glad to hear it,` said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; `for\nthe sake of his young carcase:  as would otherways have suffered\nfor it.  Come here, young `un; and let me read you a lectur`,\nwhich is as well got over at once.`\n\nThus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver`s cap\nand threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder,\nsat himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.\n\n`Now, first:  do you know wot this is?` inquired Sikes, taking up\na pocket-pistol which lay on the table.\n\nOliver replied in the affirmative.\n\n`Well, then, look here,` continued Sikes.  `This is powder; that\n`ere`s a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for\nwaddin`.`\n"}

{"text":"\nOliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies\nreferred to; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with\ngreat nicety and deliberation.\n\n`Now it`s loaded,` said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.\n\n`Yes, I see it is, sir,` replied Oliver.\n\n`Well,` said the robber, grasping Oliver`s wrist, and putting the\nbarrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment\nthe boy could not repress a start; `if you speak a word when\nyou`re out o`doors with me, except when I speak to you, that\nloading will be in your head without notice.  So, if you _do_ make\nup your mind to speak without leave, say your prayers first.`\n\nHaving bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to\nincrease its effect, Mr. Sikes continued.\n\n`As near as I know, there isn`t anybody as would be asking very\npartickler arter you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I needn`t take\nthis devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it\nwarn`t for your own good.  D`ye hear me?`\n\n`The short and the long of what you mean,` said Nancy:  speaking\nvery emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to\nbespeak his serious attention to her words:  `is, that if you`re\ncrossed by him in this job you have on hand, you`ll prevent his\never telling tales afterwards, by shooting him through the head,\nand will take your chance of swinging for it, as you do for a\ngreat many other things in the way of business, every month of\nyour life.`\n\n`That`s it!` observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; `women can always\nput things in fewest words.--Except when it`s blowing up; and\nthen they lengthens it out.  And now that he`s thoroughly up to\nit, let`s have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.`\n\nIn pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth;\ndisappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot\nof porter and a dish of sheep`s heads: which gave occasion to\nseveral pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded\nupon the singular coincidence of `jemmies` being a can name,\ncommon to them, and also to an ingenious implement much used in\nhis profession.  Indeed, the worthy gentleman, stimulated perhaps\nby the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in\ngreat spirits and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here\nremarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught,\nand did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than four-score\noaths during the whole progress of the meal.\n\nSupper being ended--it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no\ngreat appetite for it--Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses\nof spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering\nNancy, with many imprecations in case of failure, to call him at\nfive precisely.  Oliver stretched himself in his clothes, by\ncommand of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and\nthe girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse\nthem at the appointed time.\n\nFor a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that\nNancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further\nadvice; but the girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving,\nsave now and then to trim the light.  Weary with watching and\nanxiety, he at length fell asleep.\n\nWhen he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes\nwas thrusting various articles into the pockets of his\ngreat-coat, which hung over the back of a chair.  Nancy was\nbusily engaged in preparing breakfast.  It was not yet daylight;\nfor the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside.\nA sharp rain, too, was beating against the window-panes; and the\nsky looked black and cloudy.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Now, then!` growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; `half-past\nfive!  Look sharp, or you`ll get no breakfast; for it`s late as\nit is.`\n\nOliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some\nbreakfast, he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying\nthat he was quite ready.\n\nNancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to\ntie round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button\nover his shoulders.  Thus attired, he gave his hand to the\nrobber, who, merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture\nthat he had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat,\nclasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy,\nled him away.\n\nOliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the\nhope of meeting a look from the girl.

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE EXPEDITION\n\nIt was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing\nand raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy.  The\nnight had been very wet: large pools of water had collected in\nthe road: and the kennels were overflowing.  There was a faint\nglimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it rather aggravated\nthan relieved the gloom of the scene:  the sombre light only\nserving to pale that which the street lamps afforded, without\nshedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house-tops,\nand dreary streets.  There appeared to be nobody stirring in that\nquarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all closely\nshut; and the streets through which they passed, were noiseless\nand empty.\n\nBy the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day\nhad fairly begun to break.  Many of the lamps were already\nextinguished; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on,\ntowards London; now and then, a stage-coach, covered with mud,\nrattled briskly by: the driver bestowing, as he passed, an\nadmonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on the\nwrong side of the road, had endangered his arriving at the\noffice, a quarter of a minute after his time.  The public-houses,\nwith gas-lights burning inside, were already open.  By degrees,\nother shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people were\nmet with.  Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to\ntheir work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads;\ndonkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with\nlive-stock or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an\nunbroken concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies\nto the eastern suburbs of the town.  As they approached the City,\nthe noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the\nstreets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a\nroar of sound and bustle.  It was as light as it was likely to\nbe, till night came on again, and the busy morning of half the\nLondon population had begun.\n\nTurning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury\nsquare, Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into\nBarbican: thence into Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from\nwhich latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that\nfilled Oliver Twist with amazement.\n\nIt was market-morning.  The ground was covered, nearly\nankle-deep, with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually\nrising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with\nthe fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily\nabove.  All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many\ntemporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space, were\nfilled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long\nlines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep.  Countrymen,\nbutchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds\nof every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the\nwhistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and\nplunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and\nsqueaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and\nquarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells and roar of\nvoices, that issued from every public-house; the crowding,\npushing, driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and\ndiscordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market;\nand the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly\nrunning to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng;\nrendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite\nconfounded the senses.\n\nMr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the\nthickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the\nnumerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy.  He\nnodded, twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as\nmany invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward,\nuntil they were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way\nthrough Hosier Lane into Holborn.\n\n`Now, young `un!` said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St.\nAndrew`s Church, `hard upon seven! you must step out.  Come,\ndon`t lag behind already, Lazy-legs!`\n\nMr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little\ncompanion`s wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of\ntrot between a fast walk and a run, kept up with the rapid\nstrides of the house-breaker as well as he could.\n\nThey held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde\nPark corner, and were on their way to Kensington:  when Sikes\nrelaxed his pace, until an empty cart which was at some little\ndistance behind, came up.  Seeing `Hounslow` written on it, he\nasked the driver with as much civility as he could assume, if he\nwould give them a lift as far as Isleworth.\n\n`Jump up,` said the man.  `Is that your boy?`\n\n`Yes; he`s my boy,` replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and\nputting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol\nwas.\n\n`Your father walks rather too quick for you, don`t he, my man?`\ninquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.\n\n`Not a bit of it,` replied Sikes, interposing.  `He`s used to it.\n\nHere, take hold of my hand, Ned.  In with you!`\n\nThus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the\ndriver, pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there,\nand rest himself.\n"}

{"text":"\nAs they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more\nand more, where his companion meant to take him.  Kensington,\nHammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed;\nand yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun\ntheir journey.  At length, they came to a public-house called the\nCoach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road\nappeared to run off.  And here, the cart stopped.\n\nSikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the\nhand all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a\nfurious look upon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist,\nin a significant manner.\n\n`Good-bye, boy,` said the man.\n\n`He`s sulky,` replied Sikes, giving him a shake; `he`s sulky.  A\nyoung dog!  Don`t mind him.`\n\n`Not I!` rejoined the other, getting into his cart.  `It`s a fine\nday, after all.`  And he drove away.\n\nSikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver\nhe might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward\non his journey.\n\nThey turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house;\nand then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time:\npassing many large gardens and gentlemen`s houses on both sides\nof the way, and stopping for nothing but a little beer, until\nthey reached a town.  Here against the wall of a house, Oliver\nsaw written up in pretty large letters, `Hampton.`  They lingered\nabout, in the fields, for some hours.  At length they came back\ninto the town; and, turning into an old public-house with a\ndefaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire.\n\nThe kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across\nthe middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them,\nby the fire; on which were seated several rough men in\nsmock-frocks, drinking and smoking.  They took no notice of\nOliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little\nnotice of them, he and his young comrade sat in a corner by\nthemselves, without being much troubled by their company.\n\nThey had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it,\nwhile Mr. Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that\nOliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any\nfurther.  Being much tired with the walk, and getting up so\nearly, he dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by\nfatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep.\n\nIt was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes.\nRousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he\nfound that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a\nlabouring man, over a pint of ale.\n\n`So, you`re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?` inquired\nSikes.\n\n`Yes, I am,` replied the man, who seemed a little the worse--or\nbetter, as the case might be--for drinking; `and not slow about\nit neither.  My horse hasn`t got a load behind him going back, as\nhe had coming up in the mornin`; and he won`t be long a-doing of\nit.  Here`s luck to him.  Ecod! he`s a good `un!`\n\n`Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?` demanded\nSikes, pushing the ale towards his new friend.\n\n`If you`re going directly, I can,` replied the man, looking out\nof the pot.  `Are you going to Halliford?`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Going on to Shepperton,` replied Sikes.\n\n`I`m your man, as far as I go,` replied the other.  `Is all paid,\nBecky?`\n\n`Yes, the other gentleman`s paid,` replied the girl.\n\n`I say!` said the man, with tipsy gravity; `that won`t do, you\nknow.`\n\n`Why not?` rejoined Sikes.  `You`re a-going to accommodate us,\nand wot`s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in\nreturn?`\n\nThe stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound\nface; having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand:  and declared\nhe was a real good fellow.  To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was\njoking; as, if he had been sober, there would have been strong\nreason to suppose he was.\n\nAfter the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the\ncompany good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots\nand glasses as they did so, and lounging out to the door, with\nher hands full, to see the party start.\n\nThe horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was\nstanding outside:  ready harnessed to the cart.  Oliver and Sikes\ngot in without any further ceremony; and the man to whom he\nbelonged, having lingered for a minute or two `to bear him up,`\nand to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal,\nmounted also.  Then, the hostler was told to give the horse his\nhead; and, his head being given him, he made a very unpleasant\nuse of it:  tossing it into the air with great disdain, and\nrunning into the parlour windows over the way; after performing\nthose feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his\nhind-legs, he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the\ntown right gallantly.\n\nThe night was very dark.  A damp mist rose from the river, and\nthe marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary\nfields.  It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black.\nNot a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes\nwas in no mood to lead him into conversation.  Oliver sat huddled\ntogether, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and\napprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees,\nwhose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic\njoy at the desolation of the scene.\n\nAs they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven.  There was\na light in the ferry-house window opposite:  which streamed\nacross the road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark\nyew-tree with graves beneath it.  There was a dull sound of\nfalling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred\ngently in the night wind.  It seemed like quiet music for the\nrepose of the dead.\n\nSunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely\nroad.  Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped.  Sikes\nalighted, took Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.\n\nThey turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had\nexpected; but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through\ngloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, until they came within\nsight of the lights of a town at no great distance.  On looking\nintently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them,\nand that they were coming to the foot of a bridge.\n\nSikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge;\nthen turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.\n\n`The water!` thought Oliver, turning sick with fear.  `He has\nbrought me to this lonely place to murder me!`\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE BURGLARY\n\n`Hallo!` cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in\nthe passage.\n\n`Don`t make such a row,` said Sikes, bolting the door.  `Show a\nglim, Toby.`\n\n`Aha! my pal!` cried the same voice.  `A glim, Barney, a glim!\nShow the gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.`\n\nThe speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article,\nat the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers:  for\nthe noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and\nthen an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and\nawake.\n\n`Do you hear?` cried the same voice.  `There`s Bill Sikes in the\npassage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping\nthere, as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing\nstronger.  Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron\ncandlestick to wake you thoroughly?`\n\nA pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor\nof the room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued,\nfrom a door on the right hand; first, a feeble candle:  and next,\nthe form of the same individual who has been heretofore described\nas labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose,\nand officiating as waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill.\n\n`Bister Sikes!` exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy;\n`cub id, sir; cub id.`\n\n`Here! you get on first,` said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of\nhim.  `Quicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.`\n\nMuttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before\nhim; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or\nthree broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch:  on which,\nwith his legs much higher than his head, a man was reposing at\nfull length, smoking a long clay pipe.  He was dressed in a\nsmartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an\norange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern waistcoat;\nand drab breeches.  Mr. Crackit (for he it was) had no very great\nquantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had,\nwas of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls,\nthrough which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers,\nornamented with large common rings.  He was a trifle above the\nmiddle size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this\ncircumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his\ntop-boots, which he contemplated, in their elevated situation,\nwith lively satisfaction.\n\n`Bill, my boy!` said this figure, turning his head towards the\ndoor, `I`m glad to see you.  I was almost afraid you`d given it\nup:  in which case I should have made a personal wentur.  Hallo!`\n\nUttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his\neyes rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a\nsitting posture, and demanded who that was.\n\n`The boy.  Only the boy!` replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards\nthe fire.\n\n`Wud of Bister Fagid`s lads,` exclaimed Barney, with a grin.\n\n`Fagin`s, eh!` exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver.  `Wot an\ninwalable boy that`ll make, for the old ladies` pockets in\nchapels!  His mug is a fortin` to him.`\n\n`There--there`s enough of that,` interposed Sikes, impatiently;\nand stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words\nin his ear:  at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured\nOliver with a long stare of astonishment.\n\n`Now,` said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, `if you`ll give us\nsomething to eat and drink while we`re waiting, you`ll put some\nheart in us; or in me, at all events.  Sit down by the fire,\nyounker, and rest yourself; for you`ll have to go out with us\nagain to-night, though not very far off.`\n"}

{"text":"\nOliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a\nstool to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands,\nscarecely knowing where he was, or what was passing around him.\n\n`Here,` said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of\nfood, and a bottle upon the table,  `Success to the crack!`  He\nrose to honour the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty\npipe in a corner, advanced to the table, filled a glass with\nspirits, and drank off its contents.  Mr. Sikes did the same.\n\n`A drain for the boy,` said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass.\n`Down with it, innocence.`\n\n`Indeed,` said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man`s face;\n`indeed, I--`\n\n`Down with it!` echoed Toby.  `Do you think I don`t know what`s\ngood for you?  Tell him to drink it, Bill.`\n\n`He had better!` said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket.\n`Burn my body, if he isn`t more trouble than a whole family of\nDodgers.  Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!`\n\nFrightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver\nhastily swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell\ninto a violent fit of coughing:  which delighted Toby Crackit and\nBarney, and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.\n\nThis done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could\neat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him\nswallow), the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short\nnap.  Oliver retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a\nblanket, stretched himself on the floor:  close outside the\nfender.\n\nThey slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring\nbut Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire.\nOliver fell into a heavy doze:  imagining himself straying along\nthe gloomy lanes, or wandering about the dark churchyard, or\nretracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day:  when\nhe was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was\nhalf-past one.\n\nIn an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were\nactively engaged in busy preparation.  Sikes and his companion\nenveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on\ntheir great-coats; Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth\nseveral articles, which he hastily crammed into the pockets.\n\n`Barkers for me, Barney,` said Toby Crackit.\n\n`Here they are,` replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols.\n`You loaded them yourself.`\n\n`All right!` replied Toby, stowing them away.  `The persuaders?`\n\n`I`ve got `em,` replied Sikes.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies--nothing forgotten?` inquired\nToby:  fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of\nhis coat.\n\n`All right,` rejoined his companion.  `Bring them bits of timber,\nBarney.  That`s the time of day.`\n\nWith these words, he took a thick stick from Barney`s hands, who,\nhaving delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on\nOliver`s cape.\n\n`Now then!` said Sikes, holding out his hand.\n\nOliver:  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise,\nand the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him:  put\nhis hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the\npurpose.\n\n`Take his other hand, Toby,` said Sikes.  `Look out, Barney.`\n\nThe man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was\nquiet.  The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them.\nBarney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and\nwas soon asleep again.\n\nIt was now intensely dark.  The fog was much heavier than it had\nbeen in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so\ndamp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver`s hair and eyebrows,\nwithin a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff\nwith the half-frozen moisture that was floating about.  They\ncrossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he had\nseen before.  They were at no great distance off; and, as they\nwalked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.\n\n`Slap through the town,` whispered Sikes; `there`ll be nobody in\nthe way, to-night, to see us.`\n\nToby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the\nlittle town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted.  A dim\nlight shone at intervals from some bed-room window; and the\nhoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the\nnight.  But there was nobody abroad.  They had cleared the town,\nas the church-bell struck two.\n\nQuickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand.\nAfter walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a\ndetached house surrounded by a wall:  to the top of which, Toby\nCrackit, scarcely pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.\n\n`The boy next,` said Toby.  `Hoist him up; I`ll catch hold of\nhim.`\n\nBefore Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under\nthe arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on\nthe grass on the other side.  Sikes followed directly.  And they\nstole cautiously towards the house.\n\nAnd now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and\nterror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were\nthe objects of the expedition.  He clasped his hands together,\nand involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror.  A\nmist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy\nface; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees.\n\n`Get up!` murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the\npistol from his pocket; `Get up, or I`ll strew your brains upon\nthe grass.`\n\n`Oh! for God`s sake let me go!` cried Oliver; `let me run away\nand die in the fields.  I will never come near London; never,\nnever!  Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal.  For\nthe love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy\nupon me!`\n\nThe man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and\nhad cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp,\nplaced his hand upon the boy`s mouth, and dragged him to the\nhouse.\n\n`Hush!` cried the man; `it won`t answer here.  Say another word,\nand I`ll do your business myself with a crack on the head.  That\nmakes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel.  Here,\nBill, wrench the shutter open.  He`s game enough now, I`ll\nengage.  I`ve seen older hands of his age took the same way, for\na minute or two, on a cold night.`\n\nSikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin`s head for\nsending Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously,\nbut with little noise.  After some delay, and some assistance\nfrom Toby, the shutter to which he had referred, swung open on\nits hinges.\n\nIt was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above\nthe ground, at the back of the house:  which belonged to a\nscullery, or small brewing-place, at the end of the passage.  The\naperture was so small, that the inmates had probably not thought\nit worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large\nenough to admit a boy of Oliver`s size, nevertheless.  A very\nbrief exercise of Mr. Sike`s art, sufficed to overcome the\nfastening of the lattice; and it soon stood wide open also.\n\n`Now listen, you young limb,` whispered Sikes, drawing a dark\nlantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver`s\nface; `I`m a going to put you through there.  Take this light; go\nsoftly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little\nhall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.`\n\n`There`s a bolt at the top, you won`t be able to reach,`\ninterposed Toby. `Stand upon one of the hall chairs.  There are\nthree there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold\npitchfork on `em:  which is the old lady`s arms.`\n\n`Keep quiet, can`t you?` replied Sikes, with a threatening look.\n`The room-door is open, is it?`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Wide,` replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. `The\ngame of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so\nthat the dog, who`s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the\npassage when he feels wakeful.  Ha! ha! Barney `ticed him away\nto-night.  So neat!`\n\nAlthough Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and\nlaughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be\nsilent, and to get to work.  Toby complied, by first producing\nhis lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by planting\nhimself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window,\nand his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back.\nThis was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oiver\ngently through the window with his feet first; and, without\nleaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the floor\ninside.\n\n`Take this lantern,` said Sikes, looking into the room.  `You see\nthe stairs afore you?`\n\nOliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, `Yes.`  Sikes, pointing\nto the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to\ntake notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he\nfaltered, he would fall dead that instant.\n\n`It`s done in a minute,` said Sikes, in the same low whisper.\n`Directly I leave go of you, do your work.  Hark!`\n\n`What`s that?` whispered the other man.\n\nThey listened intently.\n\n`Nothing,` said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver.  `Now!`\n\nIn the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had\nfirmly resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he\nwould make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm\nthe family.  Filled with this idea, he advanced at once, but\nstealthily.\n\n`Come back!` suddenly cried Sikes aloud.  `Back! back!`\n\nScared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place,\nand by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall,\nand knew not whether to advance or fly.\n\nThe cry was repeated--a light appeared--a vision of two terrified\nhalf-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes--a\nflash--a loud noise--a smoke--a crash somewhere, but where he\nknew not,--and he staggered back.\n\nSikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and\nhad him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away.  He\nfired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating;\nand dragged the boy up.\n\n`Clasp your arm tighter,` said Sikes, as he drew him through the\nwindow.  `Give me a shawl here.  They`ve hit him.  Quick!  How\nthe boy bleeds!`\n\nThen came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of\nfire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being\ncarried over uneven ground at a rapid pace.  And then, the noises\ngrew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept\nover the boy`s heart; and he saw or heard no more.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nWHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN\nMR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE\nSUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS\n\nThe night was bitter cold.  The snow lay on the ground, frozen\ninto a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted\ninto byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that\nhowled abroad:  which, as if expending increased fury on such\nprey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling\nit into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air.  Bleak,\ndark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed and\nfed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at\nhome; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and\ndie.  Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare\nstreets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they\nmay, can hardly open them in a more bitter world.\n\nSuch was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the\nmatron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already\nintroduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down\nbefore a cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with\nno small degree of complacency, at a small round table:  on which\nstood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all necessary\nmaterials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy.  In\nfact, Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea.\nAs she glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the\nsmallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a\nsmall voice, her inward satisfaction evidently increased,--so\nmuch so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.\n\n`Well!` said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and\nlooking reflectively at the fire; `I`m sure we have all on us a\ngreat deal to be grateful for!  A great deal, if we did but know\nit.  Ah!`\n\nMrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental\nblindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a\nsilver spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a\ntwo-ounce tin tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.\n\nHow slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail\nminds!  The black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran\nover while Mrs. Corney was moralising; and the water slightly\nscalded Mrs. Corney`s hand.\n\n`Drat the pot!` said the worthy matron, setting it down very\nhastily on the hob; `a little stupid thing, that only holds a\ncouple of cups!  What use is it of, to anybody!  Except,` said\nMrs. Corney, pausing, `except to a poor desolate creature like\nme.  Oh dear!`\n\nWith these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once\nmore resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary\nfate.  The small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her\nmind sad recollections of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more\nthan five-and-twenty years); and she was overpowered.\n\n`I shall never get another!` said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; `I\nshall never get another--like him.`\n\nWhether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot,\nis uncertain.  It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney\nlooked at it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards.  She had\njust tasted her first cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap\nat the room-door.\n\n`Oh, come in with you!` said Mrs. Corney, sharply.  `Some of the\nold women dying, I suppose.  They always die when I`m at meals.\nDon`t stand there, letting the cold air in, don`t.  What`s amiss\nnow, eh?`\n\n`Nothing, ma`am, nothing,` replied a man`s voice.\n\n`Dear me!` exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, `is that\nMr. Bumble?`\n\n`At your service, ma`am,` said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping\noutside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his\ncoat; and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in\none hand and a bundle in the other.  `Shall I shut the door,\nma`am?`\n\nThe lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any\nimpropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed\ndoors.  Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being\nvery cold himself, shut it without permission.\n\n`Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,` said the matron.\n\n`Hard, indeed, ma`am,` replied the beadle.  `Anti-porochial\nweather this, ma`am.  We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have\ngiven away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a\nhalf, this very blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not\ncontented.`\n\n`Of course not.  When would they be, Mr. Bumble?` said the\nmatron, sipping her tea.\n"}

{"text":"\n`When, indeed, ma`am!` rejoined Mr. Bumble.  `Why here`s one man\nthat, in consideration of his wife and large family, has a\nquartern loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight.  Is he\ngrateful, ma`am?  Is he grateful?  Not a copper farthing`s worth\nof it!  What does he do, ma`am, but ask for a few coals; if it`s\nonly a pocket handkerchief full, he says!  Coals! What would he\ndo with coals?  Toast his cheese with `em and then come back for\nmore.  That`s the way with these people, ma`am; give `em a apron\nfull of coals to-day, and they`ll come back for another, the day\nafter to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.`\n\nThe matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible\nsimile; and the beadle went on.\n\n`I never,` said Mr. Bumble, `see anything like the pitch it`s got\nto.  The day afore yesterday, a man--you have been a married\nwoman, ma`am, and I may mention it to you--a man, with hardly a\nrag upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to\nour overseer`s door when he has got company coming to dinner; and\nsays, he must be relieved, Mrs. Corney.  As he wouldn`t go away,\nand shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him out a\npound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal.  \"My heart!\" says\nthe ungrateful villain, \"what`s the use of _this_ to me?  You might\nas well give me a pair of iron spectacles!\"  \"Very good,\" says\nour overseer, taking `em away again, \"you won`t get anything else\nhere.\"  \"Then I`ll die in the streets!\" says the vagrant.  \"Oh\nno, you won`t,\" says our overseer.`\n\n`Ha! ha!  That was very good!  So like Mr. Grannett, wasn`t it?`\ninterposed the matron.  `Well, Mr. Bumble?`\n\n`Well, ma`am,` rejoined the beadle, `he went away; and he _did_ die\nin the streets.  There`s a obstinate pauper for you!`\n\n`It beats anything I could have believed,` observed the matron\nemphatically.  `But don`t you think out-of-door relief a very bad\nthing, any way, Mr. Bumble?  You`re a gentleman of experience,\nand ought to know.  Come.`\n\n`Mrs. Corney,` said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are\nconscious of superior information, `out-of-door relief, properly\nmanaged: properly managed, ma`am: is the porochial safeguard.  The\ngreat principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers\nexactly what they don`t want; and then they get tired of coming.`\n\n`Dear me!` exclaimed Mrs. Corney.  `Well, that is a good one,\ntoo!`\n\n`Yes.  Betwixt you and me, ma`am,` returned Mr. Bumble, `that`s\nthe great principle; and that`s the reason why, if you look at\nany cases that get into them owdacious newspapers, you`ll always\nobserve that sick families have been relieved with slices of\ncheese.  That`s the rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country.\nBut, however,` said the beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle,\n`these are official secrets, ma`am; not to be spoken of; except,\nas I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves.\nThis is the port wine, ma`am, that the board ordered for the\ninfirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask\nthis forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!`\n\nHaving held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well\nto test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a\nchest of drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been\nwrapped; put it carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as\nif to go.\n\n`You`ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,` said the matron.\n\n`It blows, ma`am,` replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his\ncoat-collar, `enough to cut one`s ears off.`\n"}

{"text":"\nThe matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was\nmoving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory\nto bidding her good-night, bashfully inquired whether--whether he\nwouldn`t take a cup of tea?\n\nMr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his\nhat and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the\ntable.  As he slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady.  She\nfixed her eyes upon the little teapot.  Mr. Bumble coughed again,\nand slightly smiled.\n\nMrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet.\nAs she sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the\ngallant beadle; she coloured, and applied herself to the task of\nmaking his tea.  Again Mr. Bumble coughed--louder this time than\nhe had coughed yet.\n\n`Sweet?  Mr. Bumble?` inquired the matron, taking up the\nsugar-basin.\n\n`Very sweet, indeed, ma`am,` replied Mr. Bumble.  He fixed his\neyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked\ntender, Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment.\n\nThe tea was made, and handed in silence.  Mr. Bumble, having\nspread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from\nsullying the splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink;\nvarying these amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh;\nwhich, however, had no injurious effect upon his appetite, but,\non the contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his operations in\nthe tea and toast department.\n\n`You have a cat, ma`am, I see,` said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one\nwho, in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire;\n`and kittens too, I declare!`\n\n`I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can`t think,` replied the\nmatron.  `They`re _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful, that\nthey are quite companions for me.`\n\n`Very nice animals, ma`am,` replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; `so\nvery domestic.`\n\n`Oh, yes!` rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; `so fond of their\nhome too, that it`s quite a pleasure, I`m sure.`\n\n`Mrs. Corney, ma`am,` said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the\ntime with his teaspoon, `I mean to say this, ma`am; that any cat,\nor kitten, that could live with you, ma`am, and _not_ be fond of\nits home, must be a ass, ma`am.`\n\n`Oh, Mr. Bumble!` remonstrated Mrs. Corney.\n\n`It`s of no use disguising facts, ma`am,` said Mr. Bumble, slowly\nflourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which\nmade him doubly impressive; `I would drown it myself, with\npleasure.`\n\n`Then you`re a cruel man,` said the matron vivaciously, as she\nheld out her hand for the beadle`s cup; `and a very hard-hearted\nman besides.`\n\n`Hard-hearted, ma`am?` said Mr. Bumble.  `Hard?`  Mr. Bumble\nresigned his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney`s\nlittle finger as she took it; and inflicting two open-handed\nslaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched\nhis chair a very little morsel farther from the fire.\n\nIt was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been\nsitting opposite each other, with no great space between them,\nand fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in\nreceding from the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased\nthe distance between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding,\nsome prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to\nconsider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble`s part:  he being\nin some sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity, to give\nutterance to certain soft nothings, which however well they may\nbecome the lips of the light and thoughtless, do seem\nimmeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land, members\nof parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great\npublic functionaries, but more particularly beneath the\nstateliness and gravity of a beadle:  who (as is well known)\nshould be the sternest and most inflexible among them all.\n\nWhatever were Mr. Bumble`s intentions, however (and no doubt they\nwere of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice\nbefore remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr.\nBumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to\ndiminish the distance between himself and the matron; and,\ncontinuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought\nhis chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated.\n\nIndeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble\nstopped.\n"}

{"text":"\nNow, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would\nhave been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have\nfallen into Mr. Bumble`s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and\nno doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained\nwhere she was, and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.\n\n`Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?` said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea,\nand looking up into the matron`s face; `are _you_ hard-hearted,\nMrs. Corney?`\n\n`Dear me!` exclaimed the matron, `what a very curious question\nfrom a single man.  What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?`\n\nThe beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of\ntoast; whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and\ndeliberately kissed the matron.\n\n`Mr. Bumble!` cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the\nfright was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, `Mr.\nBumble, I shall scream!`  Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow\nand dignified manner, put his arm round the matron`s waist.\n\nAs the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she\nwould have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the\nexertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the\ndoor:  which was no sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with\nmuch agility, to the wine bottles, and began dusting them with\ngreat violence:  while the matron sharply demanded who was there.\n\nIt is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the\nefficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of\nextreme fear, that her voice had quite recovered all its official\nasperity.\n\n`If you please, mistress,` said a withered old female pauper,\nhideously ugly:  putting her head in at the door, `Old Sally is\na-going fast.`\n\n`Well, what`s that to me?` angrily demanded the matron.  `I can`t\nkeep her alive, can I?`\n\n`No, no, mistress,` replied the old woman, `nobody can; she`s far\nbeyond the reach of help.  I`ve seen a many people die; little\nbabes and great strong men; and I know when death`s a-coming,\nwell enough.  But she`s troubled in her mind: and when the fits\nare not on her,--and that`s not often, for she is dying very\nhard,--she says she has got something to tell, which you must\nhear.  She`ll never die quiet till you come, mistress.`\n\nAt this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety\nof invectives against old women who couldn`t even die without\npurposely annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a\nthick shawl which she hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr.\nBumble to stay till she came back, lest anything particular\nshould occur.  Bidding the messenger walk fast, and not be all\nnight hobbling up the stairs, she followed her from the room with\na very ill grace, scolding all the way.\n\nMr. Bumble`s conduct on being left to himself, was rather\ninexplicable.  He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons,\nweighed the sugar-tongs, closely inspected a silver milk-pot to\nascertain that it was of the genuine metal, and, having satisfied\nhis curiosity on these points, put on his cocked hat corner-wise,\nand danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table.\n\nHaving gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took\noff the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire\nwith his back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking\nan exact inventory of the furniture.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT.  BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE\nFOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY\n\nIt was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet\nof the matron`s room.  Her body was bent by age; her limbs\ntrembled with palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer,\nresembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than\nthe work of Nature`s hand.\n\nAlas!  How few of Nature`s faces are left alone to gladden us\nwith their beauty!  The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of\nthe world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when\nthose passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the\ntroubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven`s surface clear.  It\nis a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that\nfixed and rigid state, to subside into the long-forgotten\nexpression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very look of\nearly life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those\nwho knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin`s\nside in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth.\n\nThe old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs,\nmuttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her\ncompanion; being at length compelled to pause for breath, she\ngave the light into her hand, and remained behind to follow as\nshe might: while the more nimble superior made her way to the\nroom where the sick woman lay.\n\nIt was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the\nfarther end.  There was another old woman watching by the bed;\nthe parish apothecary`s apprentice was standing by the fire,\nmaking a toothpick out of a quill.\n\n`Cold night, Mrs. Corney,` said this young gentleman, as the\nmatron entered.\n\n`Very cold, indeed, sir,` replied the mistress, in her most civil\ntones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.\n\n`You should get better coals out of your contractors,` said the\napothecary`s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with\nthe rusty poker; `these are not at all the sort of thing for a\ncold night.`\n\n`They`re the board`s choosing, sir,` returned the matron. `The\nleast they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm:  for our\nplaces are hard enough.`\n\nThe conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick\nwoman.\n\n`Oh!` said the young mag, turning his face towards the bed, as if\nhe had previously quite forgotten the patient, `it`s all U.P.\nthere, Mrs. Corney.`\n\n`It is, is it, sir?` asked the matron.\n\n`If she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,` said the\napothecary`s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick`s point.\n`It`s a break-up of the system altogether.  Is she dozing, old\nlady?`\n\nThe attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in\nthe affirmative.\n\n`Then perhaps she`ll go off in that way, if you don`t make a\nrow,` said the young man.  `Put the light on the floor.  She\nwon`t see it there.`\n\nThe attendant did as she was told:  shaking her head meanwhile,\nto intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done\nso, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had\nby this time returned.  The mistress, with an expression of\nimpatience, wrapped herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of\nthe bed.\n\nThe apothecary`s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of\nthe toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good\nuse of it for ten minutes or so:  when apparently growing rather\ndull, he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job, and took himself off\non tiptoe.\n\nWhen they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women\nrose from the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their\nwithered hands to catch the heat.  The flame threw a ghastly\nlight on their shrivelled faces, and made their ugliness appear\nterrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low\nvoice.\n\n`Did she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?` inquired the\nmessenger.\n\n`Not a word,` replied the other.  `She plucked and tore at her\narms for a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon\ndropped off.  She hasn`t much strength in her, so I easily kept\nher quiet.  I ain`t so weak for an old woman, although I am on\nparish allowance; no, no!`\n\n`Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?`\ndemanded the first.\n\n`I tried to get it down,` rejoined the other.  `But her teeth\nwere tight set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as\nmuch as I could do to get it back again.  So I drank it; and it\ndid me good!`\n\nLooking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not\noverheard, the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled\nheartily.\n"}

{"text":"\n`I mind the time,` said the first speaker, `when she would have\ndone the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.`\n\n`Ay, that she would,` rejoined the other; `she had a merry heart.\n`A many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as\nwaxwork.  My old eyes have seen them--ay, and those old hands\ntouched them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.`\n\nStretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old\ncreature shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in\nher pocket, brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box,\nfrom which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of\nher companion, and a few more into her own.  While they were thus\nemployed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the\ndying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the\nfire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait?\n\n`Not long, mistress,` replied the second woman, looking up into\nher face.  `We have none of us long to wait for Death.  Patience,\npatience!  He`ll be here soon enough for us all.`\n\n`Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!` said the matron sternly.\n`You, Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?`\n\n`Often,` answered the first woman.\n\n`But will never be again,` added the second one; `that is, she`ll\nnever wake again but once--and mind, mistress, that won`t be for\nlong!`\n\n`Long or short,` said the matron, snappishly, `she won`t find me\nhere when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me\nagain for nothing.  It`s no part of my duty to see all the old\nwomen in the house die, and I won`t--that`s more. Mind that, you\nimpudent old harridans.  If you make a fool of me again, I`ll\nsoon cure you, I warrant you!`\n\nShe was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had\nturned towards the bed, caused her to look round.  The patient\nhad raised herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards\nthem.\n\n`Who`s that?` she cried, in a hollow voice.\n\n`Hush, hush!` said one of the women, stooping over her.  `Lie\ndown, lie down!`\n\n`I`ll never lie down again alive!` said the woman, struggling. `I\n_will_ tell her!  Come here!  Nearer!  Let me whisper in your ear.`\n\nShe clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair\nby the bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she\ncaught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude\nof eager listeners.\n\n`Turn them away,` said the woman, drowsily; `make haste! make\nhaste!`\n\nThe two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many\npiteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know\nher best friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that\nthey would never leave her, when the superior pushed them from\nthe room, closed the door, and returned to the bedside.  On being\nexcluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried through\nthe keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not\nunlikely; since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium\nprescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring under the effects\nof a final taste of gin-and-water which had been privily\nadministered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy old\nladies themselves.\n\n`Now listen to me,` said the dying woman aloud, as if making a\ngreat effort to revive one latent spark of energy.  `In this very\nroom--in this very bed--I once nursed a pretty young creetur`,\nthat was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised\nwith walking, and all soiled with dust and blood.  She gave birth\nto a boy, and died.  Let me think--what was the year again!`\n\n`Never mind the year,` said the impatient auditor; `what about\nher?`\n\n`Ay,` murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy\nstate, `what about her?--what about--I know!` she cried, jumping\nfiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her\nhead--`I robbed her, so I did!  She wasn`t cold--I tell you she\nwasn`t cold, when I stole it!`\n\n`Stole what, for God`s sake?` cried the matron, with a gesture as\nif she would call for help.\n\n`_It_!` replied the woman, laying her hand over the other`s mouth.\n`The only thing she had.  She wanted clothes to keep her warm,\nand food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her\nbosom.  It was gold, I tell you!  Rich gold, that might have\nsaved her life!`\n\n`Gold!` echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she\nfell back.  `Go on, go on--yes--what of it?  Who was the mother?\nWhen was it?`\n\n`She charge me to keep it safe,` replied the woman with a groan,\n`and trusted me as the only woman about her.  I stole it in my\nheart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the\nchild`s death, perhaps, is on me besides!  They would have\ntreated him better, if they had known it all!`\n\n`Known what?` asked the other.  `Speak!`\n\n`The boy grew so like his mother,` said the woman, rambling on,\nand not heeding the question, `that I could never forget it when\nI saw his face.  Poor girl! poor girl!  She was so young, too!\nSuch a gentle lamb!  Wait; there`s more to tell.  I have not told\nyou all, have I?`\n\n`No, no,` replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the\nwords, as they came more faintly from the dying woman.  `Be\nquick, or it may be too late!`\n\n`The mother,` said the woman, making a more violent effort than\nbefore; `the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her,\nwhispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived,\nthe day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to\nhear its poor young mother named. \"And oh, kind Heaven!\" she\nsaid, folding her thin hands together, \"whether it be boy or\ngirl, raise up some friends for it in this troubled world, and\ntake pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to its mercy!\"`\n\n`The boy`s name?` demanded the matron.\n\n`They _called_ him Oliver,` replied the woman, feebly.  `The gold I\nstole was--`\n\n`Yes, yes--what?` cried the other.\n\nShe was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but\ndrew back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and\nstiffly, into a sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid\nwith both hands, muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat,\nand fell lifeless on the bed.\n\n\n`Stone dead!` said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as\nthe door was opened.\n\n`And nothing to tell, after all,` rejoined the matron, walking\ncarelessly away.\n\nThe two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the\npreparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were\nleft alone, hovering about the body.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nWHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY\n\nWhile these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr.\nFagin sat in the old den--the same from which Oliver had been\nremoved by the girl--brooding over a dull, smoky fire.  He held a\npair of bellows upon his knee, with which he had apparently been\nendeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had\nfallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and\nhis chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on\nthe rusty bars.\n\nAt a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles\nBates, and Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the\nArtful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling.  The\ncountenance of the first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent\nat all times, acquired great additional interest from his close\nobservance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr.\nChitling`s hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion\nserved, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely\nregulating his own play by the result of his observations upon\nhis neighbour`s cards.  It being a cold night, the Dodger wore\nhis hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors.  He also\nsustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed\nfor a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for\nrefreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready\nfilled with gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company.\n\nMaster Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more\nexcitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable\nthat he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and\nmoreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all\nhighly unbecoming a scientific rubber.  Indeed, the Artful,\npresuming upon their close attachment, more than once took\noccasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these\nimproprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received\nin extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be\n`blowed,` or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some\nother neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy\napplication of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind\nof Mr. Chitling.  It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and\nhis partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far\nfrom angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him the highest\namusement, inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of\nevery deal, and protested that he had never seen such a jolly\ngame in all his born days.\n\n`That`s two doubles and the rub,` said Mr. Chitling, with a very\nlong face, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket.  `I\nnever see such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything.  Even\nwhen we`ve good cards, Charley and I can`t make nothing of `em.`\n\nEither the master or the manner of this remark, which was made\nvery ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his\nconsequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and\ninduced him to inquire what was the matter.\n\n`Matter, Fagin!` cried Charley.  `I wish you had watched the\nplay.  Tommy Chitling hasn`t won a point; and I went partners\nwith him against the Artfull and dumb.`\n\n`Ay, ay!` said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently\ndemonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason.\n`Try `em again, Tom; try `em again.`\n\n`No more of it for me, thank `ee, Fagin,` replied Mr. Chitling;\n`I`ve had enough.  That `ere Dodger has such a run of luck that\nthere`s no standing again` him.`\n\n`Ha! ha! my dear,` replied the Jew, `you must get up very early\nin the morning, to win against the Dodger.`\n\n`Morning!` said Charley Bates; `you must put your boots on\nover-night, and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass\nbetween your shoulders, if you want to come over him.`\n\nMr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much\nphilosophy, and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the\nfirst picture-card, at a shilling at a time.  Nobody accepting\nthe challenge, and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he\nproceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate\non the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu\nof counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness.\n\n`How precious dull you are, Tommy!` said the Dodger, stopping\nshort when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr.\nChitling.  `What do you think he`s thinking of, Fagin?`\n\n`How should I know, my dear?` replied the Jew, looking round as\nhe plied the bellows.  `About his losses, maybe; or the little\nretirement in the country that he`s just left, eh?  Ha! ha!  Is\nthat it, my dear?`\n\n`Not a bit of it,` replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of\ndiscourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply.  `What do _you_ say,\nCharley?`\n"}

{"text":"\n`_I_ should say,` replied Master Bates, with a grin, `that he was\nuncommon sweet upon Betsy.  See how he`s a-blushing!  Oh, my eye!\nhere`s a merry-go-rounder!  Tommy Chitling`s in love!  Oh, Fagin,\nFagin! what a spree!`\n\nThoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the\nvictim of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in\nhis chair with such violence, that he lost his balance, and\npitched over upon the floor; where (the accident abating nothing\nof his merriment) he lay at full length until his laugh was over,\nwhen he resumed his former position, and began another laugh.\n\n`Never mind him, my dear,` said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins,\nand giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the\nbellows.  `Betsy`s a fine girl.  Stick up to her, Tom.  Stick up\nto her.`\n\n`What I mean to say, Fagin,` replied Mr. Chitling, very red in\nthe face, `is, that that isn`t anything to anybody here.`\n\n`No more it is,` replied the Jew; `Charley will talk.

But it\nturned out a good job for you; didn`t it, Fagin!  And what`s six\nweeks of it?  It must come, some time or another, and why not in\nthe winter time when you don`t want to go out a-walking so much;\neh, Fagin?`\n\n`Ah, to be sure, my dear,` replied the Jew.\n\n`You wouldn`t mind it again, Tom, would you,` asked the Dodger,\nwinking upon Charley and the Jew, `if Bet was all right?`\n\n`I mean to say that I shouldn`t,` replied Tom, angrily. `There,\nnow.  Ah!  Who`ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh,\nFagin?`\n\n`Nobody, my dear,` replied the Jew; `not a soul, Tom.  I don`t\nknow one of `em that would do it besides you; not one of `em, my\ndear.`\n\n`I might have got clear off, if I`d split upon her; mightn`t I,\nFagin?` angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe.  `A word from\nme would have done it; wouldn`t it, Fagin?`\n\n`To be sure it would, my dear,` replied the Jew.\n\n`But I didn`t blab it; did I, Fagin?` demanded Tom, pouring\nquestion upon question with great volubility.\n\n`No, no, to be sure,` replied the Jew; `you were too\nstout-hearted for that.  A deal too stout, my dear!`\n\n`Perhaps I was,` rejoined Tom, looking round; `and if I was,\nwhat`s to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?`\n\nThe Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused,\nhastened to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the\ngravity of the company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal\noffender.  But, unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to\nreply that he was never more serious in his life, was unable to\nprevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr.\nChitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the\nroom and aimed a blow at the offender; who, being skilful in\nevading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his time so well\nthat it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and\ncaused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for\nbreath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.\n\n`Hark!` cried the Dodger at this moment, `I heard the tinkler.`\nCatching up the light, he crept softly upstairs.\n"}

{"text":"\nThe bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party\nwere in darkness.  After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared,\nand whispered Fagin mysteriously.\n\n`What!` cried the Jew, `alone?`\n\nThe Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of\nthe candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private\nintimation, in dumb show, that he had better not be funny just\nthen.  Having performed this friendly office, he fixed his eyes\non the Jew`s face, and awaited his directions.\n\nThe old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some\nseconds; his face working with agitation the while, as if he\ndreaded something, and feared to know the worst.  At length he\nraised his head.\n\n`Where is he?` he asked.\n\nThe Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if\nto leave the room.\n\n`Yes,` said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; `bring him down.\nHush!  Quiet, Charley!  Gently, Tom!  Scarce, scarce!`\n\nThis brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist,\nwas softly and immediately obeyed.  There was no sound of their\nwhereabout, when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the\nlight in his hand, and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock;\nwho, after casting a hurried glance round the room, pulled off a\nlarge wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face,\nand disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and unshorn: the features\nof flash Toby Crackit.\n\n`How are you, Faguey?` said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. `Pop\nthat shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to\nfind it when I cut; that`s the time of day!  You`ll be a fine\nyoung cracksman afore the old file now.`\n\nWith these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it\nround his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet\nupon the hob.\n\n`See there, Faguey,` he said, pointing disconsolately to his top\nboots; `not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a\nbubble of blacking, by Jove!   But don`t look at me in that way,\nman.  All in good time.  I can`t talk about business till I`ve\neat and drank; so produce the sustainance, and let`s have a quiet\nfill-out for the first time these three days!`\n\nThe Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were,\nupon the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker,\nwaited his leisure.\n\nTo judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to\nopen the conversation.  At first, the Jew contented himself with\npatiently watching his countenance, as if to gain from its\nexpression some clue to the intelligence he brought; but in vain.\n\nHe looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent\nrepose upon his features that they always wore:  and through\ndirt, and beard, and whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the\nself-satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an\nagony of impatience, watched every morsel he put into his mouth;\npacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible\nexcitement.  It was all of no use.  Toby continued to eat with\nthe utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more;\nthen, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass\nof spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.\n\n`First and foremost, Faguey,` said Toby.\n\n`Yes, yes!` interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.\n\nMr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and\nto declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet\nagainst the low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about\nthe level of his eye, he quietly resumed.\n\n`First and foremost, Faguey,` said the housebreaker, `how`s\nBill?`\n\n`What!` screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.\n\n`Why, you don`t mean to say--` began Toby, turning pale.\n\n`Mean!` cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. `Where\nare they?  Sikes and the boy!  Where are they?  Where have they\nbeen?  Where are they hiding?  Why have they not been here?`\n\n`The crack failed,` said Toby faintly.\n\n`I know it,` replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket\nand pointing to it.  `What more?`\n"}

He had\nrelaxed nothing of his unusual speed; but was still pressing\nonward, in the same wild and disordered manner, when the sudden\ndashing past of a carriage: and a boisterous cry from the foot\npassengers, who saw his danger:  drove him back upon the\npavement.  Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main\nstreets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at\nlength emerged on Snow Hill.  Here he walked even faster than\nbefore; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court;\nwhen, as if conscious that he was now in his proper element, he\nfell into his usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more\nfreely.\n\nNear to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens,\nupon the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and\ndismal alley, leading to Saffron Hill.  In its filthy shops are\nexposed for sale huge bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs,\nof all sizes and patterns; for here reside the traders who\npurchase them from pick-pockets.  Hundreds of these handkerchiefs\nhang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the\ndoor-posts; and the shelves, within, are piled with them.\nConfined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its\ncoffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse.  It is\na commercial colony of itself:  the emporium of petty larceny:\nvisited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent\nmerchants, who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as\nstrangely as they come.  Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper,\nand the rag-merchant, display their goods, as sign-boards to the\npetty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of\nmildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust and rot in the\ngrimy cellars.\n\nIt was into this place that the Jew turned.  He was well known to\nthe sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the\nlook-out to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along.\nHe replied to their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no\ncloser recognition until he reached the further end of the alley;\nwhen he stopped, to address a salesman of small stature, who had\nsqueezed as much of his person into a child`s chair as the chair\nwould hold, and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door.\n\n`Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!`\nsaid this respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew`s\ninquiry after his health.\n\n`The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,` said Fagin,\nelevating his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his\nshoulders.\n\n`Well, I`ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,`\nreplied the trader; `but it soon cools down again; don`t you find\nit so?`\n\nFagin nodded in the affirmative.  Pointing in the direction of\nSaffron Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.\n\n`At the Cripples?` inquired the man.\n\nThe Jew nodded.\n\n`Let me see,` pursued the merchant, reflecting.\n\n`Yes, there`s some half-dozen of `em gone in, that I knows. I\ndon`t think your friend`s there.`\n\n`Sikes is not, I suppose?` inquired the Jew, with a disappointed\ncountenance.\n\n`_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say,` replied the little man,\nshaking his head, and looking amazingly sly.  `Have you got\nanything in my line to-night?`\n\n`Nothing to-night,` said the Jew, turning away.\n\n`Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?` cried the little man,\ncalling after him.  `Stop!  I don`t mind if I have a drop there\nwith you!`\n\nBut as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he\npreferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not\nvery easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the\nCripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively`s\npresence.  By the time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had\ndisappeared; so Mr. Lively, after ineffectually standing on\ntiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him, again forced\nhimself into the little chair, and, exchanging a shake of the\nhead with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and\nmistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave\ndemeanour.\n\nThe Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by\nwhich the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons:  was\nthe public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already\nfigured.  Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked\nstraight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly\ninsinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about:\nshading his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some\nparticular person.\n\nThe room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which\nwas prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains\nof faded red, from being visible outside.  The ceiling was\nblackened, to prevent its colour from being injured by the\nflaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco\nsmoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything\nmore.  By degrees, however, as some of it cleared away through\nthe open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises\nthat greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more\naccustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware of\nthe presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded\nround a long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman\nwith a hammer of office in his hand; while a professional\ngentleman with a bluish nose, and his face tied up for the\nbenefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling piano in a remote\ncorner.\n\nAs Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running\nover the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of\norder for a song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded\nto entertain the company with a ballad in four verses, between\neach of which the accompanyist played the melody all through, as\nloud as he could.  When this was over, the chairman gave a\nsentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on the\nchairman`s right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with\ngreat applause.\n\nIt was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently\nfrom among the group.  There was the chairman himself, (the\nlandlord of the house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who,\nwhile the songs were proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and\nthither, and, seeming to give himself up to joviality, had an eye\nfor everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was\nsaid--and sharp ones, too.  Near him were the singers:\nreceiving, with professional indifference, the compliments of the\ncompany, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered\nglasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous\nadmirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in\nalmost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by\ntheir very repulsiveness.  Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in\nall its stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women:\nsome with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness\nalmost fading as you looked:  others with every mark and stamp of\ntheir sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome\nblank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young\nwomen, and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and\nsaddest portion of this dreary picture.\n\nFagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to\nface while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently\nwithout meeting that of which he was in search. Succeeding, at\nlength, in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he\nbeckoned to him slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had\nentered it.\n\n`What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?` inquired the man, as he\nfollowed him out to the landing.  `Won`t you join us?  They`ll be\ndelighted, every one of `em.`\n\nThe Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, `Is _he_\nhere?`\n\n`No,` replied the man.\n\n`And no news of Barney?` inquired Fagin.\n"}

{"text":"\n`None,` replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. `He\nwon`t stir till it`s all safe.  Depend on it, they`re on the\nscent down there; and that if he moved, he`d blow upon the thing\nat once.  He`s all right enough, Barney is, else I should have\nheard of him.  I`ll pound it, that Barney`s managing properly.\nLet him alone for that.`\n\n`Will _he_ be here to-night?` asked the Jew, laying the same\nemphasis on the pronoun as before.\n\n`Monks, do you mean?` inquired the landlord, hesitating.\n\n`Hush!` said the Jew.  `Yes.`\n\n`Certain,` replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; `I\nexpected him here before now.  If you`ll wait ten minutes, he`ll\nbe--`\n\n`No, no,` said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he\nmight be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless\nrelieved by his absence.  `Tell him I came here to see him; and\nthat he must come to me to-night.  No, say to-morrow.  As he is\nnot here, to-morrow will be time enough.`\n\n`Good!` said the man.  `Nothing more?`\n\n`Not a word now,` said the Jew, descending the stairs.\n\n`I say,` said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in\na hoarse whisper; `what a time this would be for a sell!  I`ve\ngot Phil Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!`\n\n`Ah!  But it`s not Phil Barker`s time,` said the Jew, looking up.\n\n`Phil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with\nhim; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead\nmerry lives--_while they last_.  Ha! ha! ha!`\n\nThe landlord reciprocated the old man`s laugh; and returned to\nhis guests.  The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance\nresumed its former expression of anxiety and thought.  After a\nbrief reflection, he called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man\ndrive towards Bethnal Green. He dismissed him within some quarter\nof a mile of Mr. Sikes`s residence, and performed the short\nremainder of the distance, on foot.\n\n`Now,` muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, `if there is\nany deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning\nas you are.`\n\nShe was in her room, the woman said.  Fagin crept softly\nupstairs, and entered it without any previous ceremony.  The girl\nwas alone; lying with her head upon the table, and her hair\nstraggling over it.\n\n`She has been drinking,` thought the Jew, cooly, `or perhaps she\nis only miserable.`\n\nThe old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection;\nthe noise thus occasioned, roused the girl.  She eyed his crafty\nface narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit`s\nstory.  When it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude,\nbut spoke not a word.  She pushed the candle impatiently away;\nand once or twice as she feverishly changed her position,\nshuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all.\n\nDuring the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as\nif to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes\nhaving covertly returned.  Apparently satisfied with his\ninspection, he coughed twice or thrice, and made as many efforts\nto open a conversation; but the girl heeded him no more than if\nhe had been made of stone.  At length he made another attempt;\nand rubbing his hands together, said, in his most conciliatory\ntone,\n\n`And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?`\n\nThe girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could\nnot tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her,\nto be crying.\n\n`And the boy, too,` said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a\nglimpse of her face.  `Poor leetle child!  Left in a ditch,\nNance; only think!`\n\n`The child,` said the girl, suddenly looking up, `is better where\nhe is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I\nhope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot\nthere.`\n\n`What!` cried the Jew, in amazement.\n\n`Ay, I do,` returned the girl, meeting his gaze.  `I shall be\nglad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is\nover.  I can`t bear to have him about me.  The sight of him turns\nme against myself, and all of you.`\n\n`Pooh!` said the Jew, scornfully.  `You`re drunk.`\n\n`Am I?` cried the girl bitterly.  `It`s no fault of yours, if I\nam not!  You`d never have me anything else, if you had your will,\nexcept now;--the humour doesn`t suit you, doesn`t it?`\n\n`No!` rejoined the Jew, furiously.  `It does not.`\n\n`Change it, then!` responded the girl, with a laugh.\n\n`Change it!` exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by\nhis companion`s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the\nnight, `I _will_ change it!  Listen to me, you drab.  Listen to me,\nwho with six words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his\nbull`s throat between my fingers now.  If he comes back, and\nleaves the boy behind him; if he gets off free, and dead or\nalive, fails to restore him to me; murder him yourself if you\nwould have him escape Jack Ketch.  And do it the moment he sets\nfoot in this room, or mind me, it will be too late!`\n\n`What is all this?` cried the girl involuntarily.\n"}

{"text":"\n`What is it?` pursued Fagin, mad with rage.  `When the boy`s\nworth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me\nin the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang\nthat I could whistle away the lives of!  And me bound, too, to a\nborn devil that only wants the will, and has the power to, to--`\n\nPanting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that\ninstant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole\ndemeanour.  A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the\nair; his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion;\nbut now, he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled\nwith the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden\nvillainy.  After a short silence, he ventured to look round at\nhis companion.  He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her\nin the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her.\n\n`Nancy, dear!` croaked the Jew, in his usual voice.  `Did you\nmind me, dear?`\n\n`Don`t worry me now, Fagin!` replied the girl, raising her head\nlanguidly.  `If Bill has not done it this time, he will another.\nHe has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when\nhe can; and when he can`t he won`t; so no more about that.`\n\n`Regarding this boy, my dear?` said the Jew, rubbing the palms of\nhis hands nervously together.\n\n`The boy must take his chance with the rest,` interrupted Nancy,\nhastily; `and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm`s\nway, and out of yours,--that is, if Bill comes to no harm.  And\nif Toby got clear off, Bill`s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill`s\nworth two of Toby any time.`\n\n`And about what I was saying, my dear?` observed the Jew, keeping\nhis glistening eye steadily upon her.\n\n`Your must say it all over again, if it`s anything you want me to\ndo,` rejoined Nancy; `and if it is, you had better wait till\nto-morrow.  You put me up for a minute; but now I`m stupid\nagain.`\n\nFagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of\nascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded\nhints; but, she answered them so readily, and was withal so\nutterly unmoved by his searching looks, that his original\nimpression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was\nconfirmed.  Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which\nwas very common among the Jew`s female pupils; and in which, in\ntheir tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than checked.\nHer disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva\nwhich pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory\nevidence of the justice of the Jew`s supposition; and when, after\nindulging in the temporary display of violence above described,\nshe subsided, first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound\nof feelings: under the influence of which she shed tears one\nminute, and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of\n`Never say die!` and divers calculations as to what might be the\namount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy, Mr.\nFagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his\ntime, saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone\nindeed.\n\nHaving eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished\nhis twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that\nnight, heard, and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes\nhad not returned, Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward:\nleaving his young friend asleep, with her head upon the table.\n\nIt was within an hour of midnight.  The weather being dark, and\npiercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter.  The sharp\nwind that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of\npassengers, as of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and\nthey were to all appearance hastening fast home. It blew from the\nright quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he\nwent: trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust drove him\nrudely on his way.\n\nHe had reached the corner of his own street, and was already\nfumbling in his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure\nemerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and,\ncrossing the road, glided up to him unperceived.\n\n`Fagin!` whispered a voice close to his ear.\n\n`Ah!` said the Jew, turning quickly round, `is that--`\n\n`Yes!` interrupted the stranger.  `I have been lingering here\nthese two hours.  Where the devil have you been?`\n\n`On your business, my dear,` replied the Jew, glancing uneasily\nat his companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke.  `On your\nbusiness all night.`\n\n`Oh, of course!` said the stranger, with a sneer.  `Well; and\nwhat`s come of it?`\n\n`Nothing good,` said the Jew.\n\n`Nothing bad, I hope?` said the stranger, stopping short, and\nturning a startled look on his companion.\n\nThe Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the\nstranger, interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which\nthey had by this time arrived:  remarking, that he had better say\nwhat he had got to say, under cover:  for his blood was chilled\nwith standing about so long, and the wind blew through him.\n\nFagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from\ntaking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed,\nmuttered something about having no fire; but his companion\nrepeating his request in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the\ndoor, and requested him to close it softly, while he got a light.\n\n`It`s as dark as the grave,` said the man, groping forward a few\nsteps.  `Make haste!`\n\n`Shut the door,` whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As\nhe spoke, it closed with a loud noise.\n\n`That wasn`t my doing,` said the other man, feeling his way. `The\nwind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other.\nLook sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against\nsomething in this confounded hole.`\n\nFagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs.  After a short\nabsence, he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence\nthat Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the\nboys were in the front one.  Beckoning the man to follow him, he\nled the way upstairs.\n\n`We can say the few words we`ve got to say in here, my dear,`\nsaid the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; `and as\nthere are holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our\nneighbours, we`ll set the candle on the stairs.  There!`\n\nWith those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an\nupper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door.  This\ndone, he led the way into the apartment; which was destitute of\nall movables save a broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa\nwithout covering, which stood behind the door.  Upon this piece\nof furniture, the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary\nman; and the Jew, drawing up the arm-chair opposite, they sat\nface to face.  It was not quite dark; the door was partially\nopen; and the candle outside, threw a feeble reflection on the\nopposite wall.\n\nThey conversed for some time in whispers.  Though nothing of the\nconversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words\nhere and there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin\nappeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the\nstranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable\nirritation.  They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of\nan hour or more, when Monks--by which name the Jew had designated\nthe strange man several times in the course of their\ncolloquy--said, raising his voice a little,\n"}

{"text":"\n`I tell you again, it was badly planned.  Why not have kept him\nhere among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket\nof him at once?`\n\n`Only hear him!` exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n`Why, do you mean to say you couldn`t have done it, if you had\nchosen?` demanded Monks, sternly.  `Haven`t you done it, with\nother boys, scores of times?  If you had had patience for a\ntwelvemonth, at most, couldn`t you have got him convicted, and\nsent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for life?`\n\n`Whose turn would that have served, my dear?` inquired the Jew\nhumbly.\n\n`Mine,` replied Monks.\n\n`But not mine,` said the Jew, submissively.  `He might have\nbecome of use to me.  When there are two parties to a bargain, it\nis only reasonable that the interests of both should be\nconsulted; is it, my good friend?`\n\n`What then?` demanded Monks.\n\n`I saw it was not easy to train him to the business,` replied the\nJew; `he was not like other boys in the same circumstances.`\n\n`Curse him, no!` muttered the man, `or he would have been a\nthief, long ago.`\n\n`I had no hold upon him to make him worse,` pursued the Jew,\nanxiously watching the countenance of his companion.  `His hand\nwas not in.  I had nothing to frighten him with; which we always\nmust have in the beginning, or we labour in vain.  What could I\ndo?  Send him out with the Dodger and Charley?  We had enough of\nthat, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.`\n\n`_That_ was not my doing,` observed Monks.\n\n`No, no, my dear!` renewed the Jew.  `And I don`t quarrel with it\nnow; because, if it had never happened, you might never have\nclapped eyes on the boy to notice him, and so led to the\ndiscovery that it was him you were looking for.  Well!  I got him\nback for you by means of the girl; and then _she_ begins to favour\nhim.`\n\n`Throttle the girl!` said Monks, impatiently.\n\n`Why, we can`t afford to do that just now, my dear,` replied the\nJew, smiling; `and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our\nway; or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done.  I\nknow what these girls are, Monks, well.  As soon as the boy\nbegins to harden, she`ll care no more for him, than for a block\nof wood.  You want him made a thief.  If he is alive, I can make\nhim one from this time; and, if--if--` said the Jew, drawing\nnearer to the other,--`it`s not likely, mind,--but if the worst\ncomes to the worst, and he is dead--`\n\n`It`s no fault of mine if he is!` interposed the other man, with\na look of terror, and clasping the Jew`s arm with trembling\nhands.  `Mind that.  Fagin!  I had no hand in it.  Anything but\nhis death, I told you from the first.  I won`t shed blood; it`s\nalways found out, and haunts a man besides.  If they shot him\ndead, I was not the cause; do you hear me?  Fire this infernal\nden!  What`s that?`\n\n`What!` cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with\nboth arms, as he sprung to his feet.  `Where?`\n\n`Yonder! replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall.  `The\nshadow!  I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass\nalong the wainscot like a breath!`\n\nThe Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the\nroom.  The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it\nhad been placed.  It showed them only the empty staircase, and\ntheir own white faces.  They listened intently:  a profound\nsilence reigned throughout the house.\n\n`It`s your fancy,` said the Jew, taking up the light and turning\nto his companion.\n\n`I`ll swear I saw it!` replied Monks, trembling.  `It was bending\nforward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.`\n\nThe Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate,\nand, telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the\nstairs.  They looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare,\nand empty.  They descended into the passage, and thence into the\ncellars below.  The green damp hung upon the low walls; the\ntracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the\ncandle; but all was still as death.\n\n`What do you think now?` said the Jew, when they had regained the\npassage.  `Besides ourselves, there`s not a creature in the house\nexcept Toby and the boys; and they`re safe enough. See here!`\n\nAs a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his\npocket; and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had\nlocked them in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.\n\nThis accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His\nprotestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they\nproceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now,\nhe gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could\nonly have been his excited imagination.  He declined any renewal\nof the conversation, however, for that night:  suddenly\nremembering that it was past one o`clock.  And so the amiable\ncouple parted.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A\nLADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY\n\nAs it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so\nmighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the\nfire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms,\nuntil such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and\nas it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to\ninvolve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked\nwith an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had\nwhispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might\nwell thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the\nhistorian whose pen traces these words--trusting that he knows\nhis place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those\nupon earth to whom high and important authority is\ndelegated--hastens to pay them that respect which their position\ndemands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which\ntheir exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues,\nimperatively claim at his hands.  Towards this end, indeed, he\nhad purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching\nthe divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position,\nthat a beadle can do no wrong:  which could not fail to have been\nboth pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but\nwhich he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space,\nto postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on\nthe arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle\nproperly constituted:  that is to say, a parochial beadle,\nattached to a parochail workhouse, and attending in his official\ncapacity the parochial church:  is, in right and virtue of his\noffice, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of\nhumanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere\ncompanies` beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even\nchapel-of-ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly\nand inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim.\n\nMr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the\nsugar-tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and\nascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture,\ndown to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated\neach process full half a dozen times; before he began to think\nthat it was time for Mrs. Corney to return. Thinking begets\nthinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney`s approach, it\noccured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous\nway of spending the time, if he were further to allay his\ncuriousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney`s\nchest of drawers.\n\nHaving listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was\napproaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom,\nproceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the\nthree long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of\ngood fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers\nof old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield\nhim exceeding satisfaction.  Arriving, in course of time, at the\nright-hand corner drawer (in which was the key), and beholding\ntherein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a\npleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned\nwith a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old\nattitude, said, with a grave and determined air, `I`ll do it!`\nHe followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head\nin a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were\nremonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and\nthen, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much seeming\npleasure and interest.\n\nHe was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs.\nCorney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless\nstate, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one\nhand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath.\n\n`Mrs. Corney,` said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, `what\nis this, ma`am?  Has anything happened, ma`am?  Pray answer me:\nI`m on--on--` Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately\nthink of the word `tenterhooks,` so he said `broken bottles.`\n\n`Oh, Mr. Bumble!` cried the lady, `I have been so dreadfully put\nout!`\n\n`Put out, ma`am!` exclaimed Mr. Bumble; `who has dared to--?  I\nknow!` said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty,\n`this is them wicious paupers!`\n\n`It`s dreadful to think of!` said the lady, shuddering.\n\n`Then _don`t_ think of it, ma`am,` rejoined Mr. Bumble.\n\n`I can`t help it,` whimpered the lady.\n\n`Then take something, ma`am,` said Mr. Bumble soothingly.  `A\nlittle of the wine?`\n\n`Not for the world!` replied Mrs. Corney.  `I couldn`t,--oh!  The\ntop shelf in the right-hand corner--oh!`  Uttering these words,\nthe good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and\nunderwent a convulsion from internal spasms.  Mr. Bumble rushed\nto the closet; and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the\nshelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its\ncontents, and held it to the lady`s lips.\n\n`I`m better now,` said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking\nhalf of it.\n\nMr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in\nthankfulness; and, bringing them down again to the brim of the\ncup, lifted it to his nose.\n\n`Peppermint,` exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling\ngently on the beadle as she spoke.  `Try it!  There`s a little--a\nlittle something else in it.`\n\nMr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his\nlips; took another taste; and put the cup down empty.\n\n`It`s very comforting,` said Mrs. Corney.\n\n`Very much so indeed, ma`am,` said the beadle.  As he spoke, he\ndrew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had\nhappened to distress her.\n\n`Nothing,` replied Mrs. Corney.  `I am a foolish, excitable, weak\ncreetur.`\n\n`Not weak, ma`am,` retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a\nlittle closer.  `Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?`\n\n`We are all weak creeturs,` said Mrs. Corney, laying down a\ngeneral principle.\n"}

{"text":"\n`So we are,` said the beadle.\n\nNothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards.\nBy the expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the\nposition by removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney`s\nchair, where it had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney`s\napron-string, round which it gradually became entwined.\n\n`We are all weak creeturs,` said Mr. Bumble.\n\nMrs. Corney sighed.\n\n`Don`t sigh, Mrs. Corney,` said Mr. Bumble.\n\n`I can`t help it,` said Mrs. Corney.  And she sighed again.\n\n`This is a very comfortable room, ma`am,` said Mr. Bumble looking\nround.  `Another room, and this, ma`am, would be a complete\nthing.`\n\n`It would be too much for one,` murmured the lady.\n\n`But not for two, ma`am,` rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents.\n`Eh, Mrs. Corney?`\n\nMrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the\nbeadle drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney`s face.  Mrs.\nCorney, with great propriety, turned her head away, and released\nher hand to get at her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly\nreplaced it in that of Mr. Bumble.\n\n`The board allows you coals, don`t they, Mrs. Corney?` inquired\nthe beadle, affectionately pressing her hand.\n\n`And candles,` replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the\npressure.\n\n`Coals, candles, and house-rent free,` said Mr. Bumble.  `Oh,\nMrs. Corney, what an Angel you are!`\n\nThe lady was not proof against this burst of feeling.  She sank\ninto Mr. Bumble`s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation,\nimprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.\n\n`Such porochial perfection!` exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously.\n`You know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?`\n\n`Yes,` replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.\n\n`He can`t live a week, the doctor says,` pursued Mr. Bumble. `He\nis the master of this establishment; his death will cause a\nwacancy; that wacancy must be filled up.  Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a\nprospect this opens!  What a opportunity for a jining of hearts\nand housekeepings!`\n\nMrs. Corney sobbed.\n\n`The little word?` said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful\nbeauty.  `The one little, little, little word, my blessed\nCorney?`\n\n`Ye--ye--yes!` sighed out the matron.\n\n`One more,` pursued the beadle; `compose your darling feelings\nfor only one more.  When is it to come off?`\n\nMrs. Corney twice essayed to speak:  and twice failed.  At length\nsummoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble`s\nneck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that\nhe was `a irresistible duck.`\n\nMatters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the\ncontract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the\npeppermint mixture; which was rendered the more necessary, by the\nflutter and agitation of the lady`s spirits.  While it was being\ndisposed of, she acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old woman`s\ndecease.\n"}

After we`re\nmarried, dear.`\n\n`After we`re married!` exclaimed Mr. Bumble.  `It wasn`t any\nimpudence from any of them male paupers as--`\n\n`No, no, love!` interposed the lady, hastily.\n\n`If I thought it was,` continued Mr. Bumble; `if I thought as any\none of `em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely\ncountenance--`\n\n`They wouldn`t have dared to do it, love,` responded the lady.\n\n`They had better not!` said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. `Let\nme see any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to\ndo it; and I can tell him that he wouldn`t do it a second time!`\n\nUnembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have\nseemed no very high compliment to the lady`s charms; but, as Mr.\nBumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was\nmuch touched with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with\ngreat admiration, that he was indeed a dove.\n\nThe dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked\nhat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with\nhis future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night:\nmerely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers` ward, to\nabuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he\ncould fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity.\nAssured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with\na light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion:  which\nserved to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the\nundertaker.\n\nNow, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper:\nand Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon\nhimself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary\nto a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and\ndrinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual\nhour of shutting-up.  Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the\ncounter several times; but, attracting no attention, and\nbeholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little\nparlour at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see\nwhat was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward,\nhe was not a little surprised.\n\nThe cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread\nand butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle.\nAt the upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled\nnegligently in an easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of\nthe arms: an open clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered\nbread in the other.  Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening\noysters from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended to\nswallow, with remarkable avidity.  A more than ordinary redness\nin the region of the young gentleman`s nose, and a kind of fixed\nwink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree\nintoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish\nwith which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong\nappreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal\nfever, could have sufficiently accounted.\n\n`Here`s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!` said Charlotte; `try\nhim, do; only this one.`\n\n`What a delicious thing is a oyster!` remarked Mr. Claypole,\nafter he had swallowed it.  `What a pity it is, a number of `em\nshould ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn`t it, Charlotte?`\n\n`It`s quite a cruelty,` said Charlotte.\n\n`So it is,` acquiesced Mr. Claypole. `An`t yer fond of oysters?`\n\n`Not overmuch,` replied Charlotte.  `I like to see you eat `em,\nNoah dear, better than eating `em myself.`\n\n`Lor!` said Noah, reflectively; `how queer!`\n\n`Have another,` said Charlotte.  `Here`s one with such a\nbeautiful, delicate beard!`\n\n`I can`t manage any more,` said Noah.  `I`m very sorry.  Come\nhere, Charlotte, and I`ll kiss yer.`\n\n`What!` said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room.  `Say that\nagain, sir.`\n"}

Mr.\nClaypole, without making any further change in his position than\nsuffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in\ndrunken terror.\n\n`Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!` said Mr. Bumble. `How\ndare you mention such a thing, sir?  And how dare you encourage\nhim, you insolent minx?

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nLOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES\n\n`Wolves tear your throats!` muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth.\n`I wish I was among some of you; you`d howl the hoarser for it.`\n\nAs Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate\nferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the\nbody of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his\nhead, for an instant, to look back at his pursuers.\n\nThere was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but\nthe loud shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the\nbarking of the neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the\nalarm bell, resounded in every direction.\n\n`Stop, you white-livered hound!` cried the robber, shouting after\nToby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was\nalready ahead.  `Stop!`\n\nThe repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still.\nFor he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of\npistol-shot; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with.\n\n`Bear a hand with the boy,` cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to\nhis confederate.  `Come back!`\n\nToby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice,\nbroken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as\nhe came slowly along.\n\n`Quicker!` cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his\nfeet, and drawing a pistol from his pocket.  `Don`t play booty\nwith me.`\n\nAt this moment the noise grew louder.  Sikes, again looking\nround, could discern that the men who had given chase were\nalready climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and\nthat a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them.\n\n`It`s all up, Bill!` cried Toby; `drop the kid, and show `em your\nheels.`  With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the\nchance of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being\ntaken by his enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full\nspeed.  Sikes clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw\nover the prostrate form of Oliver, the cape in which he had been\nhurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as if to\ndistract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the\nboy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it\nat right angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air,\ncleared it at a bound, and was gone.\n\n`Ho, ho, there!` cried a tremulous voice in the rear. `Pincher!\nNeptune!  Come here, come here!`\n\nThe dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no\nparticular relish for the sport in which they were engaged,\nreadily answered to the command.  Three men, who had by this time\nadvanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel\ntogether.\n"}

No, no, I know my\nsitiwation!  Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.`  To tell the\ntruth, the little man _did_ seem to know his situation, and to know\nperfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his\nteeth chattered in his head as he spoke.\n\n`You are afraid, Brittles,` said Mr. Giles.\n\n`I an`t,` said Brittles.\n\n`You are,` said Giles.\n\n`You`re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,` said Brittles.\n\n`You`re a lie, Brittles,` said Mr. Giles.\n\nNow, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles`s taunt; and Mr.\nGiles`s taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the\nresponsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under\ncover of a compliment.  The third man brought the dispute to a\nclose, most philosophically.\n\n`I`ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,` said he, `we`re all\nafraid.`\n\n`Speak for yourself, sir,` said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of\nthe party.\n\n`So I do,` replied the man.  `It`s natural and proper to be\nafraid, under such circumstances.

I should have\ncommitted murder--I know I should--if we`d caught one of them\nrascals.`\n\nAs the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and\nas their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some\nspeculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their\ntemperament.\n\n`I know what it was,` said Mr. Giles; `it was the gate.`\n\n`I shouldn`t wonder if it was,` exclaimed Brittles, catching at\nthe idea.\n\n`You may depend upon it,` said Giles, `that that gate stopped the\nflow of the excitement.

{"text":"\nBy a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with\nthe same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment.  It was\nquite obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as\nthere was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had\ntaken place, because all three remembered that they had come in\nsight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance.\n\nThis dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the\nburglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an\nouthouse, and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel\ncurs, to join in the pursuit.  Mr. Giles acted in the double\ncapacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion;\nBrittles was a lad of all-work: who, having entered her service a\nmere child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he\nwas something past thirty.\n\nEncouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping\nvery close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively\nround, whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the\nthree men hurried back to a tree, behind which they had left\ntheir lantern, lest its light should inform the thieves in what\ndirection to fire.  Catching up the light, they made the best of\ntheir way home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky\nforms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been\nseen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation\nof the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly\nborne.\n\nThe air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled\nalong the ground like a dense cloud of smoke.  The grass was wet;\nthe pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp\nbreath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow\nmoaning.  Still, Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot\nwhere Sikes had left him.\n\nMorning drew on apace.  The air become more sharp and piercing,\nas its first dull hue--the death of night, rather than the birth\nof day--glimmered faintly in the sky.  The objects which had\nlooked dim and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more\ndefined, and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes.  The\nrain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among the\nleafless bushes.  But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against\nhim; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his\nbed of clay.\n"}

{"text":"\nAt length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed;\nand uttering it, the boy awoke.  His left arm, rudely bandaged in\na shawl, hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was\nsaturated with blood.  He was so weak, that he could scarcely\nraise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so, he\nlooked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain.  Trembling\nin every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he made an effort to\nstand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate\non the ground.\n\nAfter a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long\nplunged, Oliver:  urged by a creeping sickness at his heart,\nwhich seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely\ndie:  got upon his feet, and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy,\nand he staggered to and fro like a drunken man.  But he kept up,\nnevertheless, and, with his head drooping languidly on his\nbreast, went stumbling onward, he knew not whither.\n\nAnd now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on\nhis mind.  He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and\nCrackit, who were angrily disputing--for the very words they\nsaid, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention,\nas it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from\nfalling, he found that he was talking to them. Then, he was alone\nwith Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy\npeople passed them, he felt the robber`s grasp upon his wrist.\nSuddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose\ninto the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his\neyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him\nhurriedly away.  Through all these rapid visions, there ran an\nundefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented\nhim incessantly.\n\nThus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the\nbars of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way,\nuntil he reached a road.  Here the rain began to fall so heavily,\nthat it roused him.\n\nHe looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a\nhouse, which perhaps he could reach.  Pitying his condition, they\nmight have compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be\nbetter, he thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely\nopen fields.  He summoned up all his strength for one last trial,\nand bent his faltering steps towards it.\n\nAs he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he\nhad seen it before.  He remembered nothing of its details; but\nthe shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him.\n\nThat garden wall!  On the grass inside, he had fallen on his\nknees last night, and prayed the two men`s mercy.  It was the\nvery house they had attempted to rob.\n\nOliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place,\nthat, for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and\nthought only of flight.  Flight!  He could scarcely stand:  and\nif he were in full possession of all the best powers of his\nslight and youthful frame, whither could he fly?  He pushed\nagainst the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its\nhinges.  He tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked\nfaintly at the door; and, his whole strength failing him, sunk\ndown against one of the pillars of the little portico.\n"}

But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men\nequals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the\nkitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with\nhis right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of\nthe robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and\nhousemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless\ninterest.\n\n`It was about half-past two,` said Mr. Giles, `or I wouldn`t\nswear that it mightn`t have been a little nearer three, when I\nwoke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here\nMr. Giles turned round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the\ntable-cloth over him to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a\nnoise.`\n\nAt this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked\nthe housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the\ntinker, who pretended not to hear.\n\n`--Heerd a noise,` continued Mr. Giles.  `I says, at first, \"This\nis illusion\"; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd\nthe noise again, distinct.`\n\n`What sort of a noise?` asked the cook.\n\n`A kind of a busting noise,` replied Mr. Giles, looking round\nhim.\n\n`More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,`\nsuggested Brittles.\n\n`It was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,` rejoined Mr. Giles; `but, at\nthis time, it had a busting sound.  I turned down the clothes`;\ncontinued Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, `sat up in bed;\nand listened.`\n\nThe cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated `Lor!` and drew\ntheir chairs closer together.\n\n`I heerd it now, quite apparent,` resumed Mr. Giles. `\"Somebody,\"\nI says, \"is forcing of a door, or window; what`s to be done?\nI`ll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being\nmurdered in his bed; or his throat,\" I says, \"may be cut from his\nright ear to his left, without his ever knowing it.\"`\n\nHere, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the\nspeaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his\nface expressive of the most unmitigated horror.\n\n`I tossed off the clothes,` said Giles, throwing away the\ntable-cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid,\n`got softly out of bed; drew on a pair of--`\n\n`Ladies present, Mr. Giles,` murmured the tinker.\n\n`--Of _shoes_, sir,` said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great\nemphasis on the word; `seized the loaded pistol that always goes\nupstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his\nroom.  \"Brittles,\" I says, when I had woke him, \"don`t be\nfrightened!\"`\n\n`So you did,` observed Brittles, in a low voice.\n\n`\"We`re dead men, I think, Brittles,\" I says,` continued Giles;\n`\"but don`t be frightened.\"`\n\n`_Was_ he frightened?` asked the cook.\n\n`Not a bit of it,` replied Mr. Giles.  `He was as firm--ah!\npretty near as firm as I was.`\n\n`I should have died at once, I`m sure, if it had been me,`\nobserved the housemaid.\n\n`You`re a woman,` retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.\n\n`Brittles is right,` said Mr. Giles, nodding his head,\napprovingly; `from a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We,\nbeing men, took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle`s\nhob, and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark,--as it\nmight be so.`\n\nMr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his\neyes shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action,\nwhen he started violently, in common with the rest of the\ncompany, and hurried back to his chair.  The cook and housemaid\nscreamed.\n\n`It was a knock,` said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity.\n`Open the door, somebody.`\n"}

{"text":"\nNobody moved.\n\n`It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a\ntime in the morning,` said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces\nwhich surrounded him, and looking very blank himself; `but the\ndoor must be opened.  Do you hear, somebody?`\n\nMr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man,\nbeing naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and\nso held that the inquiry could not have any application to him;\nat all events, he tendered no reply. Mr. Giles directed an\nappealing glance at the tinker; but he had suddenly fallen\nasleep.  The women were out of the question.\n\n`If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of\nwitnesses,` said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, `I am ready to\nmake one.`\n\n`So am I,` said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had\nfallen asleep.\n\nBrittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being\nsomewhat re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the\nshutters) that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs;\nwith the dogs in front.  The two women, who were afraid to stay\nbelow, brought up the rear.  By the advice of Mr. Giles, they all\ntalked very loud, to warn any evil-disposed person outside, that\nthey were strong in numbers; and by a master-stoke of policy,\noriginating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the\ndogs` tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark\nsavagely.\n\nThese precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by\nthe tinker`s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly\nsaid), and gave the word of command to open the door.  Brittles\nobeyed; the group, peeping timorously over each other`s\nshoulders, beheld no more formidable object than poor little\nOliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his heavy\neyes, and mutely solicited their compassion.\n\n`A boy!` exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into\nthe background.  `What`s the matter with the--eh?--Why--Brittles--look\nhere--don`t you know?`\n\nBrittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw\nOliver, than he uttered a loud cry.  Mr. Giles, seizing the boy\nby one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged\nhim straight into the hall, and deposited him at full length on\nthe floor thereof.\n\n`Here he is!` bawled Giles, calling in a state of great\nexcitement, up the staircase; `here`s one of the thieves, ma`am!\nHere`s a thief, miss!  Wounded, miss!  I shot him, miss; and\nBrittles held the light.`\n\n`--In a lantern, miss,` cried Brittles, applying one hand to the\nside of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.\n\nThe two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence\nthat Mr. Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied\nhimself in endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die\nbefore he could be hanged.  In the midst of all this noise and\ncommotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it\nin an instant.\n\n`Giles!` whispered the voice from the stair-head.\n\n`I`m here, miss,` replied Mr. Giles.  `Don`t be frightened, miss;\nI ain`t much injured.  He didn`t make a very desperate\nresistance, miss!  I was soon too many for him.`\n\n`Hush!` replied the young lady; `you frighten my aunt as much as\nthe thieves did.  Is the poor creature much hurt?`\n\n`Wounded desperate, miss,` replied Giles, with indescribable\ncomplacency.\n\n`He looks as if he was a-going, miss,` bawled Brittles, in the\nsame manner as before.  `Wouldn`t you like to come and look at\nhim, miss, in case he should?`\n\n`Hush, pray; there`s a good man!` rejoined the lady.  `Wait\nquietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.`\n\nWith a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker\ntripped away.  She soon returned, with the direction that the\nwounded person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr.\nGiles`s room; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake\nhimself instantly to Chertsey:  from which place, he was to\ndespatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor.\n\n`But won`t you take one look at him, first, miss?` asked Mr.\nGiles, with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare\nplumage, that he had skilfully brought down.  `Not one little\npeep, miss?`\n\n`Not now, for the world,` replied the young lady.  `Poor fellow!\nOh! treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!`\n\nThe old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away,\nwith a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own\nchild.  Then, bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him\nupstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nHAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH\nOLIVER RESORTED\n\nIn a handsome room:  though its furniture had rather the air of\nold-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance:  there sat two\nladies at a well-spread breakfast-table.  Mr. Giles, dressed with\nscrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon\nthem.  He had taken his station some half-way between the\nside-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up\nto its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest\ntrifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand\nthrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by his side,\ngrasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very\nagreeable sense of his own merits and importance.\n\nOf the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the\nhigh-backed oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright\nthan she.  Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a\nquaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight concessions\nto the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old\nstyle pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately\nmanner, with her hands folded on the table before her.  Her eyes\n(and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were\nattentively upon her young companion.\n\nThe younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of\nwomanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for God`s good\npurposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety,\nsupposed to abide in such as hers.\n\nShe was not past seventeen.  Cast in so slight and exquisite a\nmould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth\nseemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit\ncompanions.  The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue\neye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her\nage, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of\nsweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about\nthe face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the\ncheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside peace and\nhappiness.\n\nShe was busily engaged in the little offices of the table.\nChancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her,\nshe playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her\nforehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of\naffection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have\nsmiled to look upon her.\n\n`And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?` asked\nthe old lady, after a pause.\n\n`An hour and twelve minutes, ma`am,` replied Mr. Giles, referring\nto a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.\n\n`He is always slow,` remarked the old lady.\n\n`Brittles always was a slow boy, ma`am,` replied the attendant.\nAnd seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for\nupwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of\nhis ever being a fast one.\n\n`He gets worse instead of better, I think,` said the elder lady.\n\n`It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other\nboys,` said the young lady, smiling.\n"}

{"text":"\nMr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging\nin a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the\ngarden-gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran\nstraight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house\nby some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly\noverturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together.\n\n`I never heard of such a thing!` exclaimed the fat gentleman. `My\ndear Mrs. Maylie--bless my soul--in the silence of the night,\ntoo--I _never_ heard of such a thing!`\n\nWith these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook\nhands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they\nfound themselves.\n\n`You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,` said the\nfat gentleman.  `Why didn`t you send?  Bless me, my man should\nhave come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would\nhave been delighted; or anybody, I`m sure, under such\ncircumstances.  Dear, dear!  So unexpected!  In the silence of\nthe night, too!`\n\nThe doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery\nhaving been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it\nwere the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way\nto transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by\npost, a day or two previous.\n\n`And you, Miss Rose,` said the doctor, turning to the young lady,\n`I--`\n\n`Oh! very much so, indeed,` said Rose, interrupting him; `but\nthere is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.`\n\n`Ah! to be sure,` replied the doctor, `so there is.  That was\nyour handiwork, Giles, I understand.`\n\nMr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to\nrights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour.\n\n`Honour, eh?` said the doctor; `well, I don`t know; perhaps it`s\nas honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your\nman at twelve paces.  Fancy that he fired in the air, and you`ve\nfought a duel, Giles.`\n\nMr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an\nunjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully,\nthat it was not for the like of him to judge about that; but he\nrather thought it was no joke to the opposite party.\n\n`Gad, that`s true!` said the doctor.  `Where is he?  Show me the\nway.  I`ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie.  That`s\nthe little window that he got in at, eh?  Well, I couldn`t have\nbelieved it!`\n\nTalking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he\nis going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne,\na surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten\nmiles round as `the doctor,` had grown fat, more from good-humour\nthan from good living:  and was as kind and hearty, and withal as\neccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that\nspace, by any explorer alive.\n\nThe doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies\nhad anticipated.  A large flat box was fetched out of the gig;\nand a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up\nand down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly\nconcluded that something important was going on above.  At length\nhe returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his\npatient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully.\n\n`This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,` said the\ndoctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it\nshut.\n"}

Such\ncommendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could\nnot, for the life of him, help postponing the explanation for a\nfew delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the\nvery zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage.\n\n`Rose wished to see the man,` said Mrs. Maylie, `but I wouldn`t\nhear of it.`\n\n`Humph!` rejoined the doctor.  `There is nothing very alarming in\nhis appearance.

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nRELATES WHAT OLIVER`S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM\n\nWith many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably\nsurprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the\nyoung lady`s arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged\nhand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much ceremony and\nstateliness, upstairs.\n\n`Now,` said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the\nhandle of a bedroom-door, `let us hear what you think of him.  He\nhas not been shaved very recently, but he don`t look at all\nferocious notwithstanding.  Stop, though!  Let me first see that\nhe is in visiting order.`\n\nStepping before them, he looked into the room.  Motioning them to\nadvance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently\ndrew back the curtains of the bed.  Upon it, in lieu of the\ndogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there\nlay a mere child:  worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a\ndeep sleep.  His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was\ncrossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm,\nwhich was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the\npillow.\n\nThe honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on,\nfor a minute or so, in silence.  Whilst he was watching the\npatient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating\nherself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver`s hair from\nhis face.  As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his\nforehead.\n\nThe boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks\nof pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love\nand affection he had never known.  Thus, a strain of gentle\nmusic, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour\nof a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes\ncall up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in\nthis life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of\na happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened;\nwhich no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.\n\n`What can this mean?` exclaimed the elder lady.  `This poor child\ncan never have been the pupil of robbers!`\n\n`Vice,` said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, `takes up her\nabode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell\nnot enshrine her?`\n\n`But at so early an age!` urged Rose.\n\n`My dear young lady,` rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking\nhis head; `crime, like death, is not confined to the old and\nwithered alone.  The youngest and fairest are too often its\nchosen victims.`\n\n`But, can you--oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy\nhas been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of\nsociety?` said Rose.\n\nThe surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he\nfeared it was very possible; and observing that they might\ndisturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.\n\n`But even if he has been wicked,` pursued Rose, `think how young\nhe is; think that he may never have known a mother`s love, or the\ncomfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of\nbread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him\nto guilt.  Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy`s sake, think of this,\nbefore you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in\nany case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment.  Oh!\nas you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of\nparents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have\ndone so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected\nwith this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!`\n"}

But to return to this boy.  The great point of\nour agreement is yet to come.  He will wake in an hour or so, I\ndare say; and although I have told that thick-headed\nconstable-fellow downstairs that he musn`t be moved or spoken to,\non peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without\ndanger.  Now I make this stipulation--that I shall examine him in\nyour presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I\ncan show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a\nreal and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall\nbe left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part,\nat all events.`\n\n`Oh no, aunt!` entreated Rose.\n\n`Oh yes, aunt!` said the doctor.  `Is is a bargain?`\n\n`He cannot be hardened in vice,` said Rose; `It is impossible.`\n\n`Very good,` retorted the doctor; `then so much the more reason\nfor acceding to my proposition.`\n\nFinally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto\nsat down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should\nawake.\n"}

{"text":"\nThe patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer\ntrial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after\nhour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily.  It was\nevening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the\nintelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be\nspoken to.  The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss\nof blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose\nsomething, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity,\nthan to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning:\nwhich he should otherwise have done.\n\nThe conference was a long one.  Oliver told them all his simple\nhistory, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of\nstrength.  It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room,\nthe feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue\nof evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him.  Oh!\nif when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed\nbut one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like\ndense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not\nless surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our\nheads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep\ntestimony of dead men`s voices, which no power can stifle, and no\npride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the\nsuffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day`s life\nbrings with it!\n\nOliver`s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and\nloveliness and virtue watched him as he slept.  He felt calm and\nhappy, and could have died without a murmur.\n\nThe momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver\ncomposed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes,\nand condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself\ndownstairs to open upon Mr. Giles.  And finding nobody about the\nparlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate the\nproceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the\nkitchen he went.\n\nThere were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic\nparliament, the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the\ntinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself\nfor the remainder of the day, in consideration of his services),\nand the constable.  The latter gentleman had a large staff, a\nlarge head, large features, and large half-boots; and he looked\nas if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale--as\nindeed he had.\n\nThe adventures of the previous night were still under discussion;\nfor Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the\ndoctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was\ncorroborating everything, before his superior said it.\n\n`Sit still!` said the doctor, waving his hand.\n\n`Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles.  `Misses wished some ale to be\ngiven out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little\nroom, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among\n`em here.`\n\nBrittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen\ngenerally were understood to express the gratification they\nderived from Mr. Giles`s condescension.  Mr. Giles looked round\nwith a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they\nbehaved properly, he would never desert them.\n\n`How is the patient to-night, sir?` asked Giles.\n\n`So-so`; returned the doctor.  `I am afraid you have got yourself\ninto a scrape there, Mr. Giles.`\n\n`I hope you don`t mean to say, sir,` said Mr. Giles, trembling,\n`that he`s going to die.  If I thought it, I should never be\nhappy again.  I wouldn`t cut a boy off:  no, not even Brittles\nhere; not for all the plate in the county, sir.`\n\n`That`s not the point,` said the doctor, mysteriously.  `Mr.\nGiles, are you a Protestant?`\n\n`Yes, sir, I hope so,` faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very\npale.\n\n`And what are _you_, boy?` said the doctor, turning sharply upon\nBrittles.\n\n`Lord bless me, sir!` replied Brittles, starting violently; `I`m\nthe same as Mr. Giles, sir.`\n\n`Then tell me this,` said the doctor, `both of you, both of you!\nAre you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy\nupstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last\nnight?  Out with it!  Come!  We are prepared for you!`\n\nThe doctor, who was universally considered one of the\nbest-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a\ndreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were\nconsiderably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other\nin a state of stupefaction.\n\n`Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?` said the\ndoctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner,\nand tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the\nexercise of that worthy`s utmost acuteness. `Something may come\nof this before long.`\n\nThe constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff\nof office: which had been reclining indolently in the\nchimney-corner.\n\n`It`s a simple question of identity, you will observe,` said the\ndoctor.\n\n`That`s what it is, sir,` replied the constable, coughing with\ngreat violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some\nof it had gone the wrong way.\n"}

Have you\ngot a coach `us here, that you could put it up in, for five or\nten minutes?`\n\nBrittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the\nbuilding, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and\nhelped his companion to put up the gig:  while Brittles lighted\nthem, in a state of great admiration.  This done, they returned\nto the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their\ngreat-coats and hats, and showed like what they were.\n\nThe man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of\nmiddle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped\npretty close; half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes.  The\nother was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather\nill-favoured countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.\n\n`Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?`\nsaid the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair\nof handcuffs on the table.  `Oh!  Good-evening, master.  Can I\nhave a word or two with you in private, if you please?`\n\nThis was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance;\nthat gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two\nladies, and shut the door.\n\n`This is the lady of the house,` said Mr. Losberne, motioning\ntowards Mrs. Maylie.\n\nMr. Blathers made a bow.  Being desired to sit down, he put his\nhat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the\nsame.  The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much\naccustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in\nit--one of the two--seated himself, after undergoing several\nmuscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into\nhis mouth, with some embarrassment.\n\n`Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,` said Blathers.\n`What are the circumstances?`\n\nMr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted\nthem at great length, and with much circumlocution.  Messrs.\nBlathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally\nexchanged a nod.\n\n`I can`t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,` said\nBlathers; `but my opinion at once is,--I don`t mind committing\nmyself to that extent,--that this wasn`t done by a yokel; eh,\nDuff?`\n"}

Where did he come from?\nHe didn`t drop out of the clouds, did he, master?`\n\n`Of course not,` replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the\ntwo ladies.  `I know his whole history: but we can talk about\nthat presently.  You would like, first, to see the place where\nthe thieves made their attempt, I suppose?`\n\n`Certainly,` rejoined Mr. Blathers.  `We had better inspect the\npremises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That`s the\nusual way of doing business.`\n\nLights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff,\nattended by the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody\nelse in short, went into the little room at the end of the\npassage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round\nby way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that,\nhad a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after\nthat, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a\npitchfork to poke the bushes with.  This done, amidst the\nbreathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr.\nGiles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation\nof their share in the previous night`s adventures: which they\nperformed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not\nmore than one important respect, the first time, and in not more\nthan a dozen the last.  This consummation being arrived at,\nBlathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council\ntogether, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a\nconsultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine,\nwould be mere child`s play.\n\nMeanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very\nuneasy state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious\nfaces.\n\n`Upon my word,` he said, making a halt, after a great number of\nvery rapid turns, `I hardly know what to do.`\n\n`Surely,` said Rose, `the poor child`s story, faithfully repeated\nto these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.`\n\n`I doubt it, my dear young lady,` said the doctor, shaking his\nhead.  `I don`t think it would exonerate him, either with them,\nor with legal functionaries of a higher grade.  What is he, after\nall, they would say?  A runaway.  Judged by mere worldly\nconsiderations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful\none.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`You believe it, surely?` interrupted Rose.\n\n`_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old\nfool for doing so,` rejoined the doctor; `but I don`t think it is\nexactly the tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.`\n\n`Why not?` demanded Rose.\n\n`Because, my pretty cross-examiner,` replied the doctor:\n`because, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points\nabout it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of\nthose that look well.  Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the\nwhy and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted.  On his\nown showing, you see, he has been the companion of thieves for\nsome time past; he has been carried to a police-officer, on a\ncharge of picking a gentleman`s pocket; he has been taken away,\nforcibly, from that gentleman`s house, to a place which he cannot\ndescribe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not\nthe remotest idea.  He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who\nseem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no;\nand is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the\nvery moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the\nvery thing that would set him all to rights, there rushes into\nthe way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him!\nAs if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself!\nDon`t you see all this?`\n\n`I see it, of course,` replied Rose, smiling at the doctor`s\nimpetuosity; `but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate\nthe poor child.`\n\n`No,` replied the doctor; `of course not!  Bless the bright eyes\nof your sex!  They never see, whether for good or bad, more than\none side of any question; and that is, always, the one which\nfirst presents itself to them.`\n\nHaving given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put\nhis hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with\neven greater rapidity than before.\n\n`The more I think of it,` said the doctor, `the more I see that\nit will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these\nmen in possession of the boy`s real story.  I am certain it will\nnot be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the\nend, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all\nthe doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially,\nwith your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery.`\n\n`Oh! what is to be done?` cried Rose.  `Dear, dear! why did they\nsend for these people?`\n\n`Why, indeed!` exclaimed Mrs. Maylie.  `I would not have had them\nhere, for the world.`\n\n`All I know is,` said Mr. Losberne, at last:  sitting down with a\nkind of desperate calmness, `that we must try and carry it off\nwith a bold face.  The object is a good one, and that must be our\nexcuse.  The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in\nno condition to be talked to any more; that`s one comfort.  We\nmust make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault\nof ours.  Come in!`\n\n`Well, master,` said Blathers, entering the room followed by his\ncolleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more.\n`This warn`t a put-up thing.`\n\n`And what the devil`s a put-up thing?` demanded the doctor,\nimpatiently.\n\n`We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,` said Blathers, turning to\nthem, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the\ndoctor`s, `when the servants is in it.`\n\n`Nobody suspected them, in this case,` said Mrs. Maylie.\n\n`Wery likely not, ma`am,` replied Blathers; `but they might have\nbeen in it, for all that.`\n\n`More likely on that wery account,` said Duff.\n\n`We find it was a town hand,` said Blathers, continuing his\nreport; `for the style of work is first-rate.`\n\n`Wery pretty indeed it is,` remarked Duff, in an undertone.\n\n`There was two of `em in it,` continued Blathers; `and they had a\nboy with `em; that`s plain from the size of the window.  That`s\nall to be said at present.  We`ll see this lad that you`ve got\nupstairs at once, if you please.`\n\n`Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?`\nsaid the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had\noccurred to him.\n\n`Oh! to be sure!` exclaimed Rose, eagerly.  `You shall have it\nimmediately, if you will.`\n\n`Why, thank you, miss!` said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve\nacross his mouth; `it`s dry work, this sort of duty.  Anythink\nthat`s handy, miss; don`t put yourself out of the way, on our\naccounts.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`What shall it be?` asked the doctor, following the young lady to\nthe sideboard.\n\n`A little drop of spirits, master, if it`s all the same,` replied\nBlathers.  `It`s a cold ride from London, ma`am; and I always\nfind that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.`\n\nThis interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who\nreceived it very graciously.  While it was being conveyed to her,\nthe doctor slipped out of the room.\n\n`Ah!` said Mr. Blathers:  not holding his wine-glass by the stem,\nbut grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his\nleft hand: and placing it in front of his chest; `I have seen a\ngood many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.`\n\n`That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,` said\nMr. Duff, assisting his colleague`s memory.\n\n`That was something in this way, warn`t it?` rejoined Mr.\nBlathers; `that was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.`\n\n`You always gave that to him` replied Duff.  `It was the Family\nPet, I tell you.  Conkey hadn`t any more to do with it than I\nhad.`\n\n`Get out!` retorted Mr. Blathers; `I know better.  Do you mind\nthat time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though?  What a\nstart that was!  Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!`\n\n`What was that?` inquired Rose:  anxious to encourage any\nsymptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.\n\n`It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down\nupon,` said Blathers.  `This here Conkey Chickweed--`\n\n`Conkey means Nosey, ma`am,` interposed Duff.\n\n`Of course the lady knows that, don`t she?` demanded Mr.\nBlathers.  `Always interrupting, you are, partner!  This here\nConkey Chickweed, miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge\nway, and he had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to\nsee cock-fighting, and badger-drawing, and that; and a wery\nintellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I`ve seen\n`em off`en.  He warn`t one of the family, at that time; and one\nnight he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in\na canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of\nnight, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had\nconcealed himself under the bed, and after committing the\nrobbery, jumped slap out of window:  which was only a story high.\nHe was wery quick about it.  But Conkey was quick, too; for he\nfired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They\nset up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about\n`em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces\nof blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and\nthere they lost `em.  However, he had made off with the blunt;\nand, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed, licensed witler,\nappeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner\nof benefits and subscriptions, and I don`t know what all, was got\nup for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about\nhis loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four\ndays, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many\npeople was afraid he might be going to make away with himself.\nOne day he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a\nprivate interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk,\nrings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active\nofficer), and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in\napprehending the man as robbed his house. \"I see him, Spyers,\"\nsaid Chickweed, \"pass my house yesterday morning,\"  \"Why didn`t\nyou up, and collar him!\" says Spyers.  \"I was so struck all of a\nheap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\"\nsays the poor man; \"but we`re sure to have him; for between ten\nand eleven o`clock at night he passed again.\"  Spyers no sooner\nheard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his\npocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he\ngoes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows\nbehind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt\nout, at a moment`s notice. He was smoking his pipe here, late at\nnight, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, \"Here he is!\nStop thief!  Murder!\"  Jem Spyers dashes out; and there he sees\nChickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry.  Away goes Spyers;\non goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out,\n\"Thieves!\" and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time,\nlike mad.  Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a\ncorner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; \"Which is\nthe man?\"  \"D--me!\" says Chickweed, \"I`ve lost him again!\"  It\nwas a remarkable occurrence, but he warn`t to be seen nowhere, so\nthey went back to the public-house. Next morning, Spyers took his\nold place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall\nman with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached\nagain.  At last, he couldn`t help shutting `em, to ease `em a\nminute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed\na-roaring out, \"Here he is!\"  Off he starts once more, with\nChickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice\nas long a run as the yesterday`s one, the man`s lost again!  This\nwas done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave\nout that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was\nplaying tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor\nMr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.`\n\n`What did Jem Spyers say?` inquired the doctor; who had returned\nto the room shortly after the commencement of the story.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Jem Spyers,` resumed the officer, `for a long time said nothing\nat all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which\nshowed he understood his business.  But, one morning, he walked\ninto the bar, and taking out his snuffbox, says \"Chickweed, I`ve\nfound out who done this here robbery.\"  \"Have you?\" said\nChickweed.  \"Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and\nI shall die contented!  Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the\nvillain!\"  \"Come!\" said Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff,\n\"none of that gammon!  You did it yourself.\"  So he had; and a\ngood bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never\nhave found it out, if he hadn`t been so precious anxious to keep\nup appearances!` said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass,\nand clinking the handcuffs together.\n\n`Very curious, indeed,` observed the doctor.  `Now, if you\nplease, you can walk upstairs.`\n\n`If _you_ please, sir,` returned Mr. Blathers.  Closely following\nMr. Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver`s bedroom; Mr.\nGiles preceding the party, with a lighted candle.\n\nOliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish\nthan he had appeared yet.  Being assisted by the doctor, he\nmanaged to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the\nstrangers without at all understanding what was going forward--in\nfact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what had been\npassing.\n\n`This,` said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great\nvehemence notwithstanding, `this is the lad, who, being\naccidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr.\nWhat-d` ye-call-him`s grounds, at the back here, comes to the\nhouse for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold\nof and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in\nhis hand:  who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I\ncan professionally certify.`\n\nMessrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus\nrecommended to their notice.  The bewildered butler gazed from\nthem towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a\nmost ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.\n\n`You don`t mean to deny that, I suppose?` said the doctor, laying\nOliver gently down again.\n\n`It was all done for the--for the best, sir,` answered Giles. `I\nam sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn`t have meddled with\nhim.  I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.`\n\n`Thought it was what boy?` inquired the senior officer.\n\n`The housebreaker`s boy, sir!` replied Giles.  `They--they\ncertainly had a boy.`\n\n`Well?  Do you think so now?` inquired Blathers.\n\n`Think what, now?` replied Giles, looking vacantly at his\nquestioner.\n\n`Think it`s the same boy, Stupid-head?` rejoined Blathers,\nimpatiently.\n\n`I don`t know; I really don`t know,` said Giles, with a rueful\ncountenance.  `I couldn`t swear to him.`\n\n`What do you think?` asked Mr. Blathers.\n\n`I don`t know what to think,` replied poor Giles.  `I don`t think\nit is the boy; indeed, I`m almost certain that it isn`t.  You\nknow it can`t be.`\n\n`Has this man been a-drinking, sir?` inquired Blathers, turning\nto the doctor.\n\n`What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!` said Duff,\naddressing Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt.\n\nMr. Losberne had been feeling the patient`s pulse during this\nshort dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside,\nand remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the\nsubject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and\nhave Brittles before them.\n\nActing upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring\napartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself\nand his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh\ncontradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no\nparticular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong\nmystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn`t\nknow the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that\nhe had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he\nwas; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in\nthe kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a\nlittle too hasty.\n\nAmong other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised,\nwhether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of\nthe fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to\nhave no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper:\na discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but\nthe doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before.\nUpon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on\nMr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under\nthe fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly\ncaught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost.  Finally,\nthe officers, without troubling themselves very much about\nOliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up\ntheir rest for that night in the town; promising to return the\nnext morning.\n\nWith the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a\nboy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over\nnight under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs.\nBlathers and Duff journeyed accordingly. The suspicious\ncircumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation,\ninto the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a\nhaystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by\nimprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and\nits comprehensive love of all the King`s subjects, held to be no\nsatisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that\nthe sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied\nwith violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to\nthe punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back\nagain, as wise as they went.\n\nIn short, after some more examination, and a great deal more\nconversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to\ntake the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver`s\nappearance if he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and\nDuff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town\nwith divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the\nlatter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the\ncircumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious\nattempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the former being\nequally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr.\nConkey Chickweed.\n\nMeanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united\ncare of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne.  If\nfervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude,\nbe heard in heaven--and if they be not, what prayers are!--the\nblessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into\ntheir souls, diffusing peace and happiness.\n\n"}

In addition to the\npain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the\nwet and cold had brought on fever and ague:  which hung about him\nfor many weeks, and reduced him sadly. But, at length, he began,\nby slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes,\nin a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the\ntwo sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew\nstrong and well again, he could do something to show his\ngratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and\nduty with which his breast was full; something, however slight,\nwhich would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been\ncast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued\nfrom misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole\nheart and soul.\n\n`Poor fellow!` said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly\nendeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his\npale lips; `you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if\nyou will.  We are going into the country, and my aunt intends\nthat you shall accompany us.  The quiet place, the pure air, and\nall the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a\nfew days.  We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can\nbear the trouble.`\n\n`The trouble!` cried Oliver.  `Oh! dear lady, if I could but work\nfor you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your\nflowers, or watching your birds, or running up and down the whole\nday long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!`\n\n`You shall give nothing at all,` said Miss Maylie, smiling; `for,\nas I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and\nif you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise\nnow, you will make me very happy indeed.`\n\n`Happy, ma`am!` cried Oliver; `how kind of you to say so!`\n\n`You will make me happier than I can tell you,` replied the young\nlady.  `To think that my dear good aunt should have been the\nmeans of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have\ndescribed to us, would be an unspeakable pleasure to me; but to\nknow that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely\ngrateful and attached, in consequence, would delight me, more\nthan you can well imagine.  Do you understand me?` she inquired,\nwatching Oliver`s thoughtful face.\n\n`Oh yes, ma`am, yes!` replied Oliver eagerly; `but I was thinking\nthat I am ungrateful now.`\n\n`To whom?` inquired the young lady.\n\n`To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much\ncare of me before,` rejoined Oliver.  `If they knew how happy I\nam, they would be pleased, I am sure.`\n\n`I am sure they would,` rejoined Oliver`s benefactress; `and Mr.\nLosberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you\nare well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see\nthem.`\n\n`Has he, ma`am?` cried Oliver, his face brightening with\npleasure.  `I don`t know what I shall do for joy when I see their\nkind faces once again!`\n\nIn a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the\nfatigue of this expedition.  One morning he and Mr. Losberne set\nout, accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs.\nMaylie.  When they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very\npale, and uttered a loud exclamation.\n\n`What`s the matter with the boy?` cried the doctor, as usual, all\nin a bustle.  `Do you see anything--hear anything--feel\nanything--eh?`\n\n`That, sir,` cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window.\n`That house!`\n\n`Yes; well, what of it?  Stop coachman.  Pull up here,` cried the\ndoctor.  `What of the house, my man; eh?`\n\n`The thieves--the house they took me to!` whispered Oliver.\n\n`The devil it is!` cried the doctor.  `Hallo, there! let me out!`\n\nBut, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had\ntumbled out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running\ndown to the deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a\nmadman.\n\n`Halloa?` said a little ugly hump-backed man:  opening the door\nso suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last\nkick, nearly fell forward into the passage. `What`s the matter\nhere?`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Matter!` exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment`s\nreflection.  `A good deal.  Robbery is the matter.`\n\n`There`ll be Murder the matter, too,` replied the hump-backed\nman, coolly, `if you don`t take your hands off.  Do you hear me?`\n\n`I hear you,` said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.\n\n`Where`s--confound the fellow, what`s his rascally name--Sikes;\nthat`s it.  Where`s Sikes, you thief?`\n\nThe hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and\nindignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the\ndoctor`s grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and\nretired into the house.  Before he could shut the door, however,\nthe doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley.\n\nHe looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a\nvestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position\nof the cupboards; answered Oliver`s description!\n\n`Now!` said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly,\n`what do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way?\nDo you want to rob me, or to murder me?  Which is it?`\n\n`Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and\npair, you ridiculous old vampire?` said the irritable doctor.\n\n`What do you want, then?` demanded the hunchback.  `Will you take\nyourself off, before I do you a mischief?  Curse you!`\n\n`As soon as I think proper,` said Mr. Losberne, looking into the\nother parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance\nwhatever to Oliver`s account of it.  `I shall find you out, some\nday, my friend.`\n\n`Will you?` sneered the ill-favoured cripple.  `If you ever want\nme, I`m here.  I haven`t lived here mad and all alone, for\nfive-and-twenty years, to be scared by you.  You shall pay for\nthis; you shall pay for this.`  And so saying, the mis-shapen\nlittle demon set up a yell, and danced upon the ground, as if\nwild with rage.\n\n`Stupid enough, this,` muttered the doctor to himself; `the boy\nmust have made a mistake.  Here!  Put that in your pocket, and\nshut yourself up again.`  With these words he flung the hunchback\na piece of money, and returned to the carriage.\n\nThe man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest\nimprecations and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned\nto speak to the driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed\nOliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at\nthe same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or\nsleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards.  He\ncontinued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the\ndriver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on\ntheir way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his\nfeet upon the ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real\nor pretended rage.\n\n`I am an ass!` said the doctor, after a long silence.  `Did you\nknow that before, Oliver?`\n\n`No, sir.`\n\n`Then don`t forget it another time.`\n\n`An ass,` said the doctor again, after a further silence of some\nminutes.  `Even if it had been the right place, and the right\nfellows had been there, what could I have done, single-handed?\nAnd if I had had assistance, I see no good that I should have\ndone, except leading to my own exposure, and an unavoidable\nstatement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business.\nThat would have served me right, though.  I am always involving\nmyself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse.  It might\nhave done me good.`\n\nNow, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon\nanything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad\ncompliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that\nso far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or\nmisfortunes, he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who\nknew him.  If the truth must be told, he was a little out of\ntemper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring\ncorroborative evidence of Oliver`s story on the very first\noccasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any.  He soon came\nround again, however; and finding that Oliver`s replies to his\nquestions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and\nstill delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as\nthey had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence\nto them, from that time forth.\n\nAs Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow\nresided, they were enabled to drive straight thither.  When the\ncoach turned into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could\nscarcely draw his breath.\n\n`Now, my boy, which house is it?` inquired Mr. Losberne.\n\n`That!  That!` replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the\nwindow.  `The white house.  Oh! make haste!  Pray make haste! I\nfeel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.`\n\n`Come, come!` said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder.\n`You will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find\nyou safe and well.`\n\n`Oh!  I hope so!` cried Oliver.  `They were so good to me; so\nvery, very good to me.`\n"}

{"text":"\nThe coach rolled on.  It stopped.  No; that was the wrong house;\nthe next door.  It went on a few paces, and stopped again.\nOliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation\ncoursing down his face.\n\nAlas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the\nwindow.  `To Let.`\n\n`Knock at the next door,` cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver`s arm\nin his.  `What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in\nthe adjoining house, do you know?`\n\nThe servant did not know; but would go and inquire.  She\npresently returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his\ngoods, and gone to the West Indies, six weeks before.  Oliver\nclasped his hands, and sank feebly backward.\n\n`Has his housekeeper gone too?` inquired Mr. Losberne, after a\nmoment`s pause.\n\n`Yes, sir`; replied the servant.  `The old gentleman, the\nhousekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow`s,\nall went together.`\n\n`Then turn towards home again,` said Mr. Losberne to the driver;\n`and don`t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this\nconfounded London!`\n\n`The book-stall keeper, sir?` said Oliver.  `I know the way\nthere.  See him, pray, sir!  Do see him!`\n\n`My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,` said\nthe doctor.  `Quite enough for both of us.  If we go to the\nbook-stall keeper`s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or\nhas set his house on fire, or run away.  No; home again\nstraight!`  And in obedience to the doctor`s impulse, home they\nwent.\n\nThis bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief,\neven in the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself,\nmany times during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr.\nBrownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it\nwould be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed\nin reflecting on what they had done for him, and in bewailing his\ncruel separation from them. The hope of eventually clearing\nhimself with them, too, and explaining how he had been forced\naway, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many of his\nrecent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so\nfar, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor\nand a robber--a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his\ndying day--was almost more than he could bear.\n\nThe circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the\nbehaviour of his benefactors.  After another fortnight, when the\nfine warm weather had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was\nputting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms, they made\npreparations for quitting the house at Chertsey, for some months.\n\nSending the plate, which had so excited Fagin`s cupidity, to the\nbanker`s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the\nhouse, they departed to a cottage at some distance in the\ncountry, and took Oliver with them.\n\nWho can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and\nsoft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and\namong the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village!  Who\ncan tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of\npain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own\nfreshness, deep into their jaded hearts!  Men who have lived in\ncrowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have\nnever wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been\nsecond nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and\nstone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks;\neven they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to\nyearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature`s face; and,\ncarried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures,\nhave seemed to pass at once into a new state of being.  Crawling\nforth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had\nsuch memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and\nhill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven\nitself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into\ntheir tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched\nfrom their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded\nfrom their dim and feeble sight!  The memories which peaceful\ncountry scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its\nthoughts and hopes.  Their gentle influence may teach us how to\nweave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved:  may\npurify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and\nhatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least\nreflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having\nheld such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time,\nwhich calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and\nbends down pride and worldliness beneath it.\n"}

{"text":"\nIt was a lovely spot to which they repaired.  Oliver, whose days\nhad been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise\nand brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there.  The rose\nand honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round\nthe trunks of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air\nwith delicious odours.  Hard by, was a little churchyard; not\ncrowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble\nmounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old\npeople of the village lay at rest.  Oliver often wandered here;\nand, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay,\nwould sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised\nhis eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of her\nas lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly, but\nwithout pain.\n\nIt was a happy time.  The days were peaceful and serene; the\nnights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in\na wretched prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but\npleasant and happy thoughts.  Every morning he went to a\nwhite-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church:\nwho taught him to read better, and to write:  and who spoke so\nkindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could never try enough\nto please him.  Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose,\nand hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some\nshady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he\ncould have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters.\nThen, he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at\nthis, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the\ngarden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk\nout again, and he with them:  listening with such pleasure to all\nthey said:  and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could\nclimb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch:\nthat he could never be quick enough about it. When it became\nquite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down\nto the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low and\ngentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear.\nThere would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and\nOliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet\nmusic, in a perfect rapture.\n\nAnd when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any\nway in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like\nall the other days in that most happy time!  There was the little\nchurch, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the\nwindows:  the birds singing without:  and the sweet-smelling air\nstealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building\nwith its fragrance. The poor people were so neat and clean, and\nknelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a\ntedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the\nsinging might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to\nOliver`s ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church\nbefore.  Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at\nthe clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver read\na chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all\nthe week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud\nand pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.\n\nIn the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o`clock, roaming\nthe fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays\nof wild flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and\nwhich it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the\nbest advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast-table.\nThere was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie`s birds, with\nwhich Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able\ntuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the\nmost approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce and\nsmart for the day, there was usually some little commission of\ncharity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was\nrare cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that,\nthere was always something to do in the garden, or about the\nplants, to which Oliver (who had studied this science also, under\nthe same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself\nwith hearty good-will, until Miss Rose made her appearance:  when\nthere were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had\ndone.\n\nSo three months glided away; three months which, in the life of\nthe most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been\nunmingled happiness, and which, in Oliver`s were true felicity.\nWith the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the\ntruest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no\nwonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had\nbecome completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece,\nand that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart,\nwas repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nWHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A\nSUDDEN CHECK\n\nSpring flew swiftly by, and summer came.  If the village had been\nbeautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of\nits richness.  The great trees, which had looked shrunken and\nbare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and\nhealth; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty\nground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where\nwas a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide\nprospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond.  The\nearth had donned her mantle of brightest green; and shed her\nrichest perfumes abroad.  It was the prime and vigour of the\nyear; all things were glad and flourishing.\n\nStill, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the\nsame cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates.  Oliver had\nlong since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made\nno difference in his warm feelings of a great many people.  He\nwas still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that\nhe had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and\nwhen he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on\nthose who tended him.\n\nOne beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was\ncustomary with them:  for the day had been unusually warm, and\nthere was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which\nwas unusually refreshing.  Rose had been in high spirits, too,\nand they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far\nexceeded their ordinary bounds.  Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they\nreturned more slowly home.  The young lady merely throwing off\nher simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual.  After running\nabstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low\nand very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as\nif she were weeping.\n\n`Rose, my dear!` said the elder lady.\n\nRose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the\nwords had roused her from some painful thoughts.\n\n`Rose, my love!` cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending\nover her.  `What is this?  In tears!  My dear child, what\ndistresses you?`\n\n`Nothing, aunt; nothing,` replied the young lady.  `I don`t know\nwhat it is; I can`t describe it; but I feel--`\n\n`Not ill, my love?` interposed Mrs. Maylie.\n\n`No, no!  Oh, not ill!` replied Rose: shuddering as though some\ndeadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; `I shall\nbe better presently.  Close the window, pray!`\n\nOliver hastened to comply with her request.  The young lady,\nmaking an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some\nlivelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys.\nCovering her face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave\nvent to the tears which she was now unable to repress.\n\n`My child!` said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, `I\nnever saw you so before.`\n\n`I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,` rejoined Rose; `but\nindeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I _am_\nill, aunt.`\n\nShe was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in\nthe very short time which had elapsed since their return home,\nthe hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness.\nIts expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was\nchanged; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle\nface, which it had never worn before.  Another minute, and it was\nsuffused with a crimson flush:  and a heavy wildness came over\nthe soft blue eye.  Again this disappeared, like the shadow\nthrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale.\n\nOliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was\nalarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing\nthat she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the\nsame, and they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by\nher aunt to retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and\nappeared even in better health:  assuring them that she felt\ncertain she should rise in the morning, quite well.\n\n`I hope,` said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, `that nothing\nis the matter?  She don`t look well to-night, but--`\n\nThe old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself\ndown in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time.\nAt length, she said, in a trembling voice:\n\n`I hope not, Oliver.  I have been very happy with her for some\nyears:  too happy, perhaps.  It may be time that I should meet\nwith some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.`\n\n`What?` inquired Oliver.\n"}

{"text":"\n`The heavy blow,` said the old lady, `of losing the dear girl who\nhas so long been my comfort and happiness.`\n\n`Oh!  God forbid!` exclaimed Oliver, hastily.\n\n`Amen to that, my child!` said the old lady, wringing her hands.\n\n`Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?` said Oliver.\n`Two hours ago, she was quite well.`\n\n`She is very ill now,` rejoined Mrs. Maylies; `and will be worse,\nI am sure.  My dear, dear Rose!  Oh, what shall I do without\nher!`\n\nShe gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his\nown emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg,\nearnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she\nwould be more calm.\n\n`And consider, ma`am,` said Oliver, as the tears forced\nthemselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary.\n`Oh! consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and\ncomfort she gives to all about her.  I am sure--certain--quite\ncertain--that, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for\nher own; and for the sake of all she makes so happy; she will not\ndie.  Heaven will never let her die so young.`\n\n`Hush!` said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver`s head. `You\nthink like a child, poor boy.  But you teach me my duty,\nnotwithstanding.  I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I\nhope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of\nillness and death to know the agony of separation from the\nobjects of our love.  I have seen enough, too, to know that it is\nnot always the youngest and best who are spared to those that\nlove them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for\nHeaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that\nthere is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it\nis speedy.  God`s will be done!  I love her; and He knows how\nwell!`\n\nOliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words,\nshe checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing\nherself up as she spoke, became composed and firm.  He was still\nmore astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that,\nunder all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was\nevery ready and collected: performing all the duties which had\ndevolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances,\neven cheerfully.  But he was young, and did not know what strong\nminds are capable of, under trying circumstances.  How should he,\nwhen their possessors so seldom know themselves?\n\nAn anxious night ensued.  When morning came, Mrs. Maylie`s\npredictions were but too well verified.  Rose was in the first\nstage of a high and dangerous fever.\n\n`We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,`\nsaid Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked\nsteadily into his face; `this letter must be sent, with all\npossible expedition, to Mr. Losberne.  It must be carried to the\nmarket-town: which is not more than four miles off, by the\nfootpath across the field:  and thence dispatched, by an express\non horseback, straight to Chertsey. The people at the inn will\nundertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I\nknow.`\n\nOliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at\nonce.\n\n`Here is another letter,` said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect;\n`but whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes\non, I scarcely know.  I would not forward it, unless I feared the\nworst.`\n\n`Is it for Chertsey, too, ma`am?` inquired Oliver; impatient to\nexecute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for\nthe letter.\n\n`No,` replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically.\nOliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry\nMaylie, Esquire, at some great lord`s house in the country;\nwhere, he could not make out.\n\n`Shall it go, ma`am?` asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.\n\n`I think not,` replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back.  `I will wait\nuntil to-morrow.`\n\nWith these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off,\nwithout more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.\n\nSwiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which\nsometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on\neither side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers\nand haymakers were busy at their work:  nor did he stop once,\nsave now and then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until he\ncame, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little\nmarket-place of the market-town.\n\nHere he paused, and looked about for the inn.  There were a white\nbank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one\ncorner there was a large house, with all the wood about it\npainted green:  before which was the sign of `The George.`  To\nthis he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye.\n\nHe spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who,\nafter hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who\nafter hearing all he had to say again, referred him to the\nlandlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white\nhat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against\na pump by the stable-door, picking his teeth with a silver\ntoothpick.\n\nThis gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make\nout the bill:  which took a long time making out:  and after it\nwas ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be\ndressed, which took up ten good minutes more.  Meanwhile Oliver\nwas in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he\nfelt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself, and\ngalloped away, full tear, to the next stage.  At length, all was\nready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many\ninjunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set\nspurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the\nmarket-place, was out of the town, and galloping along the\nturnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.\n\nAs it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for,\nand that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard,\nwith a somewhat lighter heart.  He was turning out of the gateway\nwhen he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a\ncloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door.\n\n`Hah!` cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly\nrecoiling.  `What the devil`s this?`\n\n`I beg your pardon, sir,` said Oliver; `I was in a great hurry to\nget home, and didn`t see you were coming.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Death!` muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his\nlarge dark eyes.  `Who would have thought it! Grind him to ashes!\nHe`d start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!`\n\n`I am sorry,` stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man`s\nwild look.  `I hope I have not hurt you!`\n\n`Rot you!` murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his\nclenched teeth; `if I had only had the courage to say the word, I\nmight have been free of you in a night.  Curses on your head, and\nblack death on your heart, you imp!  What are you doing here?`\n\nThe man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently.\nHe advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a\nblow at him, but fell violently on the ground:  writhing and\nfoaming, in a fit.\n\nOliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for\nsuch he supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for\nhelp.  Having seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned\nhis face homewards, running as fast as he could, to make up for\nlost time:  and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and\nsome fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he\nhad just parted.\n\nThe circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however:\nfor when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his\nmind, and to drive all considerations of self completely from his\nmemory.\n\nRose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was\ndelirious.  A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was\nin constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the\npatient, he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her\ndisorder to be one of a most alarming nature. `In fact,` he said,\n`it would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered.`\n\nHow often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing\nout, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the\nslightest sound from the sick chamber!  How often did a tremble\nshake his frame, and cold drops of terror start upon his brow,\nwhen a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something\ntoo dreadful to think of, had even then occurred!  And what had\nbeen the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered,\ncompared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and\npassion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle\ncreature, who was tottering on the deep grave`s verge!\n\nOh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly\nby while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the\nbalance!  Oh! the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and\nmake the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the\nforce of the images they conjure up before it; the desparate\nanxiety _to be doing something_ to relieve the pain, or lessen the\ndanger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul\nand spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness\nproduces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or\nendeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay\nthem!\n\nMorning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People\nspoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time\nto time; women and children went away in tears. All the livelong\nday, and for hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly\nup and down the garden, raising his eyes every instant to the\nsick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking\nas if death lay stretched inside.  Late that night, Mr. Losberne\narrived.  `It is hard,` said the good doctor, turning away as he\nspoke; `so young; so much beloved; but there is very little\nhope.`\n\nAnother morning.  The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it\nlooked upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in\nfull bloom about her; with life, and health, and sounds and\nsights of joy, surrounding her on every side: the fair young\ncreature lay, wasting fast.  Oliver crept away to the old\nchurchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and\nprayed for her, in silence.\n\nThere was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of\nbrightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome\nmusic in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid\nflight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of life and\njoyousness in all; that, when the boy raised his aching eyes, and\nlooked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him, that\nthis was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die\nwhen humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were\nfor cold and cheerless winter:  not for sunlight and fragrance.\nHe almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and\nthat they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their\nghastly folds.\n\nA knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful\nthoughts.  Another!  Again!  It was tolling for the funeral\nservice.  A group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing\nwhite favours; for the corpse was young.  They stood uncovered by\na grave; and there was a mother--a mother once--among the weeping\ntrain.  But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on.\n\nOliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had\nreceived from the young lady, and wishing that the time could\ncome again, that he might never cease showing her how grateful\nand attached he was.  He had no cause for self-reproach on the\nscore of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been devoted to\nher service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before\nhim, on which he fancied he might have been more zealous, and\nmore earnest, and wished he had been.  We need be careful how we\ndeal with those about us, when every death carries to some small\ncircle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little\ndone--of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might\nhave been repaired!  There is no remorse so deep as that which is\nunavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember\nthis, in time.\n\nWhen he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little\nparlour.  Oliver`s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never\nleft the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what\nchange could have driven her away.  He learnt that she had fallen\ninto a deep sleep, from which she would waken, either to recovery\nand life, or to bid them farewell, and die.\n\nThey sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours.  The\nuntasted meal was removed, with looks which showed that their\nthoughts were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower\nand lower, and, at length, cast over sky and earth those\nbrilliant hues which herald his departure.  Their quick ears\ncaught the sound of an approaching footstep.  They both\ninvoluntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne entered.\n\n`What of Rose?` cried the old lady.  `Tell me at once!  I can\nbear it; anything but suspense!  Oh, tell me! in the name of\nHeaven!`\n\n`You must compose yourself,` said the doctor supporting her. `Be\ncalm, my dear ma`am, pray.`\n\n`Let me go, in God`s name!  My dear child!  She is dead! She is\ndying!`\n\n`No!` cried the doctor, passionately.  `As He is good and\nmerciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.`\n\nThe lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands\ntogether; but the energy which had supported her so long, fled up\nto Heaven with her first thanksgiving; and she sank into the\nfriendly arms which were extended to receive her.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nCONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG\nGENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE\nWHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER\n\nIt was almost too much happiness to bear.  Oliver felt stunned\nand stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep,\nor speak, or rest.  He had scarcely the power of understanding\nanything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet\nevening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, and he seemed\nto awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that\nhad occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which\nhad been taken from his breast.\n\nThe night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward:  laden\nwith flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the\nadornment of the sick chamber.  As he walked briskly along the\nroad, he heard behind him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching\nat a furious pace.  Looking round, he saw that it was a\npost-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were\ngalloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning against a\ngate until it should have passed him.\n\nAs it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white\nnightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was\nso brief that he could not identify the person.  In another\nsecond or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window,\nand a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop:  which he\ndid, as soon as he could pull up his horses.  Then, the nightcap\nonce again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his\nname.\n\n`Here!` cried the voice.  `Oliver, what`s the news?  Miss Rose!\nMaster O-li-ver!`\n\n`Is is you, Giles?` cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.\n\nGiles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some\nreply, when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who\noccupied the other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded\nwhat was the news.\n\n`In a word!` cried the gentleman, `Better or worse?`\n\n`Better--much better!` replied Oliver, hastily.\n\n`Thank Heaven!` exclaimed the gentleman.  `You are sure?`\n\n`Quite, sir,` replied Oliver.  `The change took place only a few\nhours ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.`\n\nThe gentleman said not another word, but, opening the\nchaise-door, leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm,\nled him aside.\n\n`You are quite certain?  There is no possibility of any mistake\non your part, my boy, is there?` demanded the gentleman in a\ntremulous voice.  `Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are\nnot to be fulfilled.`\n\n`I would not for the world, sir,` replied Oliver.  `Indeed you\nmay believe me.  Mr. Losberne`s words were, that she would live\nto bless us all for many years to come.  I heard him say so.`\n\nThe tears stood in Oliver`s eyes as he recalled the scene which\nwas the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned\nhis face away, and remained silent, for some minutes.  Oliver\nthought he heard him sob, more than once; but he feared to\ninterrupt him by any fresh remark--for he could well guess what\nhis feelings were--and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied\nwith his nosegay.\n\nAll this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been\nsitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each\nknee, and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief\ndotted with white spots.  That the honest fellow had not been\nfeigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red\neyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned\nround and addressed him.\n\n`I think you had better go on to my mother`s in the chaise,\nGiles,` said he.  `I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a\nlittle time before I see her.  You can say I am coming.`\n\n`I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,` said Giles:  giving a final\npolish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; `but if\nyou would leave the postboy to say that, I should be very much\nobliged to you.  It wouldn`t be proper for the maids to see me in\nthis state, sir; I should never have any more authority with them\nif they did.`\n\n`Well,` rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, `you can do as you like.\nLet him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow\nwith us.  Only first exchange that nightcap for some more\nappropriate covering, or we shall be taken for madmen.`\n\nMr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and\npocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober\nshape, which he took out of the chaise.  This done, the postboy\ndrove off; Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their\nleisure.\n\nAs they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much\ninterest and curiosity at the new comer.  He seemed about\nfive-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his\ncountenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and\nprepossessing.  Notwithstanding the difference between youth and\nage, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver\nwould have had no great difficulty in imagining their\nrelationship, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother.\n\nMrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he\nreached the cottage.  The meeting did not take place without\ngreat emotion on both sides.\n\n`Mother!` whispered the young man; `why did you not write\nbefore?`\n\n`I did,` replied Mrs. Maylie; `but, on reflection, I determined\nto keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne`s\nopinion.`\n\n`But why,` said the young man, `why run the chance of that\noccurring which so nearly happened?  If Rose had--I cannot utter\nthat word now--if this illness had terminated differently, how\ncould you ever have forgiven yourself!  How could I ever have\nknow happiness again!`\n"}

{"text":"\n`If that _had_ been the case, Harry,` said Mrs. Maylie, `I fear\nyour happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that\nyour arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been\nof very, very little import.`\n\n`And who can wonder if it be so, mother?` rejoined the young man;\n`or why should I say, _if_?--It is--it is--you know it, mother--you\nmust know it!`\n\n`I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of\nman can offer,` said Mrs. Maylie; `I know that the devotion and\naffection of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that\nshall be deep and lasting.  If I did not feel this, and know,\nbesides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break\nher heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance,\nor have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I\ntake what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.`\n\n`This is unkind, mother,` said Harry.  `Do you still suppose that\nI am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of\nmy own soul?`\n\n`I think, my dear son,` returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand\nupon his shoulder, `that youth has many generous impulses which\ndo not last; and that among them are some, which, being\ngratified, become only the more fleeting.  Above all, I think`\nsaid the lady, fixing her eyes on her son`s face, `that if an\nenthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose\nname there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of\nhers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon\nhis children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the\nworld, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers\nagainst him:  he may, no matter how generous and good his nature,\none day repent of the connection he formed in early life.  And\nshe may have the pain of knowing that he does so.`\n\n`Mother,` said the young man, impatiently, `he would be a selfish\nbrute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you\ndescribe, who acted thus.`\n\n`You think so now, Harry,` replied his mother.\n\n`And ever will!` said the young man.  `The mental agony I have\nsuffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to\nyou of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of\nyesterday, nor one I have lightly formed.  On Rose, sweet, gentle\ngirl! my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on\nwoman.  I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her;\nand if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and\nhappiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind.  Mother,\nthink better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the\nhappiness of which you seem to think so little.`\n\n`Harry,` said Mrs. Maylie, `it is because I think so much of warm\nand sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded.\nBut we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter,\njust now.`\n\n`Let it rest with Rose, then,` interposed Harry.  `You will not\npress these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw\nany obstacle in my way?`\n\n`I will not,` rejoined Mrs. Maylie; `but I would have you\nconsider--`\n\n`I _have_ considered!` was the impatient reply; `Mother, I have\nconsidered, years and years.  I have considered, ever since I\nhave been capable of serious reflection.  My feelings remain\nunchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of\na delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no\nearthly good?  No!  Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear\nme.`\n\n`She shall,` said Mrs. Maylie.\n\n`There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that\nshe will hear me coldly, mother,` said the young man.\n\n`Not coldly,` rejoined the old lady; `far from it.`\n\n`How then?` urged the young man.  `She has formed no other\nattachment?`\n\n`No, indeed,` replied his mother; `you have, or I mistake, too\nstrong a hold on her affections already.  What I would say,`\nresumed the old lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak,\n`is this.  Before you stake your all on this chance; before you\nsuffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope;\nreflect for a few moments, my dear child, on Rose`s history, and\nconsider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have\non her decision:  devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity\nof her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which,\nin all matters, great or trifling, has always been her\ncharacteristic.`\n\n`What do you mean?`\n\n`That I leave you to discover,` replied Mrs. Maylie.  `I must go\nback to her.  God bless you!`\n\n`I shall see you again to-night?` said the young man, eagerly.\n\n`By and by,` replied the lady; `when I leave Rose.`\n\n`You will tell her I am here?` said Harry.\n\n`Of course,` replied Mrs. Maylie.\n\n`And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered,\nand how I long to see her.  You will not refuse to do this,\nmother?`\n\n`No,` said the old lady; `I will tell her all.`  And pressing her\nson`s hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.\n\nMr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the\napartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding.  The\nformer now held out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty\nsalutations were exchanged between them.  The doctor then\ncommunicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young\nfriend, a precise account of his patient`s situation; which was\nquite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver`s statement\nhad encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles,\nwho affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy\nears.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?` inquired the\ndoctor, when he had concluded.\n\n`Nothing particular, sir,` replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the\neyes.\n\n`Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?`\nsaid the doctor.\n\n`None at all, sir,` replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.\n\n`Well,` said the doctor, `I am sorry to hear it, because you do\nthat sort of thing admirably.  Pray, how is Brittles?`\n\n`The boy is very well, sir,` said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual\ntone of patronage; `and sends his respectful duty, sir.`\n\n`That`s well,` said the doctor.  `Seeing you here, reminds me,\nMr. Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away\nso hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a\nsmall commission in your favour.  Just step into this corner a\nmoment, will you?`\n\nMr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some\nwonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with\nthe doctor, on the termination of which, he made a great many\nbows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness.  The subject\nmatter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour, but\nthe kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles\nwalked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale,\nannounced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective,\nthat it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his gallant\nbehaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit,\nin the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds, for\nhis sole use and benefit.  At this, the two women-servants lifted\nup their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out\nhis shirt-frill, replied, `No, no`; and that if they observed\nthat he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them\nto tell him so.  And then he made a great many other remarks, no\nless illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal\nfavour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to\nthe purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.\n\nAbove stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully\naway; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or\nthoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not\nproof against the worthy gentleman`s good humour, which displayed\nitself in a great variety of sallies and professional\nrecollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck\nOliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused\nhim to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the\ndoctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh\nalmost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy.  So, they were\nas pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well\nhave been; and it was late before they retired, with light and\nthankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and\nsuspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.\n\nOliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his\nusual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known\nfor many days.  The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in\ntheir old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be\nfound, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty.\nThe melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious\nboy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all\nwere, was dispelled by magic.  The dew seemed to sparkle more\nbrightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a\nsweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright.\nSuch is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts,\nexercise, even over the appearance of external objects.  Men who\nlook on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark\nand gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are\nreflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.  The real\nhues are delicate, and need a clearer vision.\n\nIt is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the\ntime, that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone.\nHarry Maylie, after the very first morning when he met Oliver\ncoming laden home, was seized with such a passion for flowers,\nand displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left his\nyoung companion far behind.  If Oliver were behindhand in these\nrespects, he knew where the best were to be found; and morning\nafter morning they scoured the country together, and brought home\nthe fairest that blossomed.  The window of the young lady`s\nchamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air\nstream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always\nstood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little\nbunch, which was made up with great care, every morning.  Oliver\ncould not help noticing that the withered flowers were never\nthrown away, although the little vase was regularly replenished;\nnor, could he help observing, that whenever the doctor came into\nthe garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular\ncorner, and nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth on\nhis morning`s walk.  Pending these observations, the days were\nflying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.\n\nNor did Oliver`s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young\nlady had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening\nwalks, save now and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie.\nHe applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions\nof the white-headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his\nquick progress surprised even himself.  It was while he was\nengaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly startled and\ndistressed by a most unexpected occurrence.\n\nThe little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at\nhis books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house.  It\nwas quite a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which\nwere clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the\ncasement, and filled the place with their delicious perfume.  It\nlooked into a garden, whence a wicket-gate opened into a small\npaddock; all beyond, was fine meadow-land and wood.  There was no\nother dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it\ncommanded was very extensive.\n\nOne beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were\nbeginning to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window,\nintent upon his books.  He had been poring over them for some\ntime; and, as the day had been uncommonly sultry, and he had\nexerted himself a great deal, it is no disparagement to the\nauthors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and\nby slow degrees, he fell asleep.\n\nThere is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which,\nwhile it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a\nsense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its\npleasure.  So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of\nstrength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power\nof motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a\nconsciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream\nat such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which\nreally exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with\nsurprising readiness to our visions, until reality and\nimagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards\nalmost matter of impossibility to separate the two.  Nor is this,\nthe most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state.  It is\nan undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be\nfor the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary\nscenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially\ninfluenced, by the _mere silent presence_ of some external object;\nwhich may not have been near us when we closed our eyes:  and of\nwhose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.\n\nOliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room;\nthat his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet\nair was stirring among the creeping plants outside.  And yet he\nwas asleep.  Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close\nand confined; and he thought, with a glow of terror, that he was\nin the Jew`s house again. There sat the hideous old man, in his\naccustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering to another\nman, with his face averted, who sat beside him.\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nCONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER`S ADVENTURE; AND A\nCONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE\n\nWhen the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver`s cries,\nhurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him,\npale and agitated, pointing in the direction of the meadows\nbehind the house, and scarcely able to articulate the words, `The\nJew! the Jew!`\n\nMr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but\nHarry Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who\nhad heard Oliver`s history from his mother, understood it at\nonce.\n\n`What direction did he take?` he asked, catching up a heavy stick\nwhich was standing in a corner.\n\n`That,` replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had\ntaken; `I missed them in an instant.`\n\n`Then, they are in the ditch!` said Harry.  `Follow!  And keep as\nnear me, as you can.` So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and\ndarted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding\ndifficulty for the others to keep near him.\n\nGiles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and\nin the course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out\nwalking, and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after\nthem, and picking himself up with more agility than he could have\nbeen supposed to possess, struck into the same course at no\ncontemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to\nknow what was the matter.\n\nOn they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the\nleader, striking off into an angle of the field indicated by\nOliver, began to search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining;\nwhich afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up;\nand for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances\nthat had led to so vigorous a pursuit.\n\nThe search was all in vain.  There were not even the traces of\nrecent footsteps, to be seen.  They stood now, on the summit of a\nlittle hill, commanding the open fields in every direction for\nthree or four miles.  There was the village in the hollow on the\nleft; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver\nhad pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground,\nwhich it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short\na time.  A thick wood skirted the meadow-land in another\ndirection; but they could not have gained that covert for the\nsame reason.\n\n`It must have been a dream, Oliver,` said Harry Maylie.\n\n`Oh no, indeed, sir,` replied Oliver, shuddering at the very\nrecollection of the old wretch`s countenance; `I saw him too\nplainly for that.  I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.`\n\n`Who was the other?` inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.\n\n`The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at\nthe inn,` said Oliver.  `We had our eyes fixed full upon each\nother; and I could swear to him.`\n\n`They took this way?` demanded Harry:  `are you sure?`\n\n`As I am that the men were at the window,` replied Oliver,\npointing down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the\ncottage-garden from the meadow.  `The tall man leaped over, just\nthere; and the Jew, running a few paces to the right, crept\nthrough that gap.`\n\nThe two gentlemen watched Oliver`s earnest face, as he spoke, and\nlooking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the\naccuracy of what he said.  Still, in no direction were there any\nappearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.  The grass\nwas long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own\nfeet had crushed it.  The sides and brinks of the ditches were of\ndamp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of\nmen`s shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any\nfeet had pressed the ground for hours before.\n\n`This is strange!` said Harry.\n\n`Strange?` echoed the doctor.  `Blathers and Duff, themselves,\ncould make nothing of it.`\n\nNotwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search,\nthey did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its\nfurther prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with\nreluctance.  Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in\nthe village, furnished with the best description Oliver could\ngive of the appearance and dress of the strangers.  Of these, the\nJew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered,\nsupposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but\nGiles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or\nlessen the mystery.\n\nOn the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries\nrenewed; but with no better success.  On the day following,\nOliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the market-town, in the hope of\nseeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was\nequally fruitless.  After a few days, the affair began to be\nforgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food\nto support it, dies away of itself.\n\nMeanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering.  She had left her room:\nwas able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried\njoy into the hearts of all.\n\nBut, although this happy change had a visible effect on the\nlittle circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter\nwere once more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an\nunwonted restraint upon some there:  even upon Rose herself:\nwhich Oliver could not fail to remark.  Mrs. Maylie and her son\nwere often closeted together for a long time; and more than once\nRose appeared with traces of tears upon her face.  After Mr.\nLosberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey, these\nsymptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in\nprogress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of\nsomebody else besides.\n"}

{"text":"\nAt length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the\nbreakfast-parlour, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some\nhesitation, begged permission to speak with her for a few\nmoments.\n\n`A few--a very few--will suffice, Rose,` said the young man,\ndrawing his chair towards her.  `What I shall have to say, has\nalready presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes\nof my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have\nnot heard them stated.`\n\nRose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that\nmight have been the effect of her recent illness.  She merely\nbowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in\nsilence for him to proceed.\n\n`I--I--ought to have left here, before,` said Harry.\n\n`You should, indeed,` replied Rose.  `Forgive me for saying so,\nbut I wish you had.`\n\n`I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all\napprehensions,` said the young man; `the fear of losing the one\ndear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.  You had\nbeen dying; trembling between earth and heaven.  We know that\nwhen the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited with\nsickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright\nhome of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! that the best and\nfairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.`\n\nThere were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words\nwere spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she\nbent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more\nbeautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young\nheart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in\nnature.\n\n`A creature,` continued the young man, passionately, `a creature\nas fair and innocent of guile as one of God`s own angels,\nfluttered between life and death.  Oh! who could hope, when the\ndistant world to which she was akin, half opened to her view,\nthat she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this!  Rose,\nRose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow,\nwhich a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope\nthat you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know\na reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that\nbright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have\nwinged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these\nconsolations, that you might be restored to those who loved\nyou--these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were\nmine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing\ntorrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest\nyou should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as\nalmost bore down sense and reason in its course.  You recovered.\nDay by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came\nback, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which\ncirculated languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and\nrushing tide.  I have watched you change almost from death, to\nlife, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep\naffection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it\nhas softened my heart to all mankind.`\n\n`I did not mean that,` said Rose, weeping; `I only wish you had\nleft here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits\nagain; to pursuits well worthy of you.`\n\n`There is no pursuit more worthy of me:  more worthy of the\nhighest nature that exists:  than the struggle to win such a\nheart as yours,` said the young man, taking her hand. `Rose, my\nown dear Rose!  For years--for years--I have loved you; hoping to\nwin my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it\nhad been pursued only for you to share; thinking, in my\ndaydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the\nmany silent tokens I had given of a boy`s attachment, and claim\nyour hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had\nbeen sealed between us!  That time has not arrived; but here,\nwith not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the\nheart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with\nwhich you greet the offer.`\n\n`Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.` said Rose,\nmastering the emotions by which she was agitated.  `As you\nbelieve that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my\nanswer.`\n\n`It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?`\n\n`It is,` replied Rose, `that you must endeavour to forget me; not\nas your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound\nme deeply; but, as the object of your love.  Look into the world;\nthink how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there.\nConfide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the\ntruest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.`\n"}

It is a duty that I must\nperform.  I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.`\n\n`To yourself?`\n\n`Yes, Harry.  I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless,\nportionless, girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give\nyour friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to\nyour first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on all your\nhopes and projects.

Most painful to\nme, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for\nit _will_ be happiness to know that I once held the high place in\nyour regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in\nlife will animate me with new fortitude and firmness.  Farewell,\nHarry!  As we have met to-day, we meet no more; but in other\nrelations than those in which this conversation have placed us,\nwe may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that\nthe prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the\nsource of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!`\n\n`Another word, Rose,` said Harry.  `Your reason in your own\nwords.  From your own lips, let me hear it!`\n\n`The prospect before you,` answered Rose, firmly, `is a brilliant\none.  All the honours to which great talents and powerful\nconnections can help men in public life, are in store for you.\nBut those connections are proud; and I will neither mingle with\nsuch as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring\ndisgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied\nthat mother`s place.  In a word,` said the young lady, turning\naway, as her temporary firmness forsook her, `there is a stain\nupon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads.  I will\ncarry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest\nalone on me.`\n\n`One word more, Rose.  Dearest Rose! one more!` cried Harry,\nthrowing himself before her.  `If I had been less--less\nfortunate, the world would call it--if some obscure and peaceful\nlife had been my destiny--if I had been poor, sick,\nhelpless--would you have turned from me then?  Or has my probable\nadvancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?`\n\n`Do not press me to reply,` answered Rose.  `The question does\nnot arise, and never will.  It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge\nit.`\n\n`If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,` retorted\nHarry, `it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and\nlight the path before me.  It is not an idle thing to do so much,\nby the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you\nbeyond all else.  Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring\nattachment; in the name of all I have suffered for you, and all\nyou doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!`\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nIN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN\nMATRIMONIAL CASES\n\nMr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily\nfixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no\nbrighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly\nrays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining\nsurface.  A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he\noccasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the\nheedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, Mr. Bumble\nwould heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread\nhis countenance.  Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might be that the\ninsects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past\nlife.\n\nNor was Mr. Bumble`s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a\npleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not\nwanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his\nown person, which announced that a great change had taken place\nin the position of his affairs.  The laced coat, and the cocked\nhat; where were they?  He still wore knee-breeches, and dark\ncotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not _the_\nbreeches.  The coat was wide-skirted; and in that respect like\n_the_ coat, but, oh how different!  The mighty cocked hat was\nreplaced by a modest round one.  Mr. Bumble was no longer a\nbeadle.\n\nThere are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more\nsubstantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and\ndignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them.  A\nfield-marshal has his uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a\ncounsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat.  Strip the\nbishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are\nthey?  Men.  Mere men.  Dignity, and even holiness too,\nsometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some\npeople imagine.\n\nMr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the\nworkhouse.  Another beadle had come into power.  On him the\ncocked hat, gold-laced coat, and staff, had all three descended.\n\n`And to-morrow two months it was done!` said Mr. Bumble, with a\nsigh.  `It seems a age.`\n\nMr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole\nexistence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but\nthe sigh--there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.\n\n`I sold myself,` said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of\nrelection, `for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a\nmilk-pot; with a small quantity of second-hand furniture, and\ntwenty pound in money.  I went very reasonable.  Cheap, dirt\ncheap!`\n\n`Cheap!` cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble`s ear: `you would\nhave been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord\nabove knows that!`\n\nMr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting\nconsort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had\noverheard of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at\na venture.\n\n`Mrs. Bumble, ma`am!` said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental\nsternness.\n\n`Well!` cried the lady.\n\n`Have the goodness to look at me,` said Mr. Bumble, fixing his\neyes upon her.  (If she stands such a eye as that,` said Mr.\nBumble to himself, `she can stand anything.  It is a eye I never\nknew to fail with paupers.  If it fails with her, my power is\ngone.`)\n\nWhether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to\nquell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high\ncondition; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof\nagainst eagle glances; are matters of opinion.  The matter of\nfact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr.\nBumble`s scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great\ndisdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as\nthough it were genuine.\n"}

{"text":"\nOn hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first\nincredulous, and afterwards amazed.  He then relapsed into his\nformer state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was\nagain awakened by the voice of his partner.\n\n`Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?` inquired Mrs.\nBumble.\n\n`I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma`am,`\nrejoined Mr. Bumble; `and although I was _not_ snoring, I shall\nsnore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me;\nsuch being my prerogative.`\n\n`_Your_ prerogative!` sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt.\n\n`I said the word, ma`am,` said Mr. Bumble.  `The prerogative of a\nman is to command.`\n\n`And what`s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?`\ncried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.\n\n`To obey, ma`am,` thundered Mr. Bumble.  `Your late unfortunate\nhusband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might\nhave been alive now.  I wish he was, poor man!`\n\nMrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now\narrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or\nother, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard\nthis allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a\nchair, and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted\nbrute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.\n\nBut, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble`s\nsoul; his heart was waterproof.  Like washable beaver hats that\nimprove with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more\nvigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness,\nand so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted\nhim.  He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and\nbegged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her\nhardest:  the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as\nstrongly conducive to health.\n\n`It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes,\nand softens down the temper,` said Mr. Bumble.  `So cry away.`\n\nAs he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his\nhat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side,\nas a man might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a\nbecoming manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered\ntowards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his\nwhole appearance.\n\nNow, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were\nless troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite\nprepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr.\nBumble was not long in discovering.\n\nThe first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a\nhollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of\nhis hat to the opposite end of the room.  This preliminary\nproceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady, clasping him\ntightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of\nblows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the\nother.  This done, she created a little variety by scratching his\nface, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted\nas much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she\npushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the\npurpose:  and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if\nhe dared.\n\n`Get up!` said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command.  `And take\nyourself away from here, unless you want me to do something\ndesperate.`\n\nMr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance:  wondering much\nwhat something desperate might be.  Picking up his hat, he looked\ntowards the door.\n\n`Are you going?` demanded Mrs. Bumble.\n\n`Certainly, my dear, certainly,` rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a\nquicker motion towards the door.  `I didn`t intend to--I`m going,\nmy dear!  You are so very violent, that really I--`\n\nAt this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace\nthe carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle.  Mr. Bumble\nimmediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another\nthought on his unfinished sentence:  leaving the late Mrs. Corney\nin full possession of the field.\n\nMr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten.  He\nhad a decided propensity for bullying:  derived no inconsiderable\npleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently,\nwas (it is needless to say) a coward.  This is by no means a\ndisparagement to his character; for many official personages, who\nare held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of\nsimilar infirmities.  The remark is made, indeed, rather in his\nfavour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader\nwith a just sense of his qualifications for office.\n"}

{"text":"\nBut, the measure of his degradation was not yet full.  After\nmaking a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time,\nthat the poor-laws really were too hard on people; and that men\nwho ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the\nparish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at\nall, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had\nsuffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female\npaupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen:  when\nthe sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.\n\n`Hem!` said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity.\n`These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative.\nHallo! hallo there!  What do you mean by this noise, you\nhussies?`\n\nWith these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with\na very fierce and angry manner:  which was at once exchanged for\na most humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly\nrested on the form of his lady wife.\n\n`My dear,` said Mr. Bumble, `I didn`t know you were here.`\n\n`Didn`t know I was here!` repeated Mrs. Bumble.  `What do _you_ do\nhere?`\n\n`I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their\nwork properly, my dear,` replied Mr. Bumble:  glancing\ndistractedly at a couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were\ncomparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master`s humility.\n\n`_You_ thought they were talking too much?` said Mrs. Bumble. `What\nbusiness is it of yours?`\n\n`Why, my dear--` urged Mr. Bumble submissively.\n\n`What business is it of yours?` demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.\n\n`It`s very true, you`re matron here, my dear,` submitted Mr.\nBumble; `but I thought you mightn`t be in the way just then.`\n\n`I`ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,` returned his lady.  `We don`t\nwant any of your interference.  You`re a great deal too fond of\npoking your nose into things that don`t concern you, making\neverybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and\nmaking yourself look like a fool every hour in the day.  Be off;\ncome!`\n\nMr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the\ntwo old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously,\nhesitated for an instant.  Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no\ndelay, caught up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards\nthe door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain of receiving\nthe contents upon his portly person.\n\nWhat could Mr. Bumble do?  He looked dejectedly round, and slunk\naway; and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers\nbroke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight.  It wanted\nbut this.  He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and\nstation before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the\nheight and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most\nsnubbed hen-peckery.\n\n`All in two months!` said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal\nthoughts.  `Two months!  No more than two months ago, I was not\nonly my own master, but everybody else`s, so far as the porochial\nworkhouse was concerned, and now!--`\n\nIt was too much.  Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened\nthe gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie);\nand walked, distractedly, into the street.\n\nHe walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had\nabated the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of\nfeeling made him thirsty.  He passed a great many public-houses;\nbut, at length paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as\nhe gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save\nby one solitary customer.  It began to rain, heavily, at the\nmoment.  This determined him.  Mr. Bumble stepped in; and\nordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the\napartment into which he had looked from the street.\n\nThe man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large\ncloak.  He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain\nhaggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his\ndress, to have travelled some distance.  He eyed Bumble askance,\nas he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in\nacknowledgment of his salutation.\n\nMr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that\nthe stranger had been more familiar:  so he drank his\ngin-and-water in silence, and read the paper with great show of\npomp and circumstance.\n\nIt so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men\nfall into company under such circumstances:  that Mr. Bumble\nfelt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he could\nnot resist, to steal a look at the stranger:  and that whenever\nhe did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion, to find that\nthe stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him.  Mr.\nBumble`s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable\nexpression of the stranger`s eye, which was keen and bright, but\nshadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he\nhad ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.\n\nWhen they had encountered each other`s glance several times in\nthis way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.\n\n`Were you looking for me,` he said, `when you peered in at the\nwindow?`\n\n`Not that I am aware of, unless you`re Mr. --`  Here Mr. Bumble\nstopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger`s name,\nand thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank.\n\n`I see you were not,` said the stranger; an expression of quiet\nsarcasm playing about his mouth; `or you have known my name.  You\ndon`t know it.  I would recommend you not to ask for it.`\n\n`I meant no harm, young man,` observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.\n\n`And have done none,` said the stranger.\n\nAnother silence succeeded this short dialogue:  which was again\nbroken by the stranger.\n\n`I have seen you before, I think?` said he.  `You were\ndifferently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the\nstreet, but I should know you again.  You were beadle here, once;\nwere you not?`\n\n`I was,` said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; `porochial beadle.`\n\n`Just so,` rejoined the other, nodding his head.  `It was in that\ncharacter I saw you.  What are you now?`\n\n`Master of the workhouse,` rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and\nimpressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might\notherwise assume.  `Master of the workhouse, young man!`\n\n`You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had,\nI doubt not?` resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr.\nBumble`s eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Don`t scruple to answer freely, man.  I know you pretty well,\nyou see.`\n\n`I suppose, a married man,` replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes\nwith his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in\nevident perplexity, `is not more averse to turning an honest\npenny when he can, than a single one.  Porochial officers are not\nso well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee,\nwhen it comes to them in a civil and proper manner.`\n\nThe stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say,\nhe had not mistaken his man; then rang the bell.\n\n`Fill this glass again,` he said, handing Mr. Bumble`s empty\ntumbler to the landlord.  `Let it be strong and hot.  You like it\nso, I suppose?`\n\n`Not too strong,` replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.\n\n`You understand what that means, landlord!` said the stranger,\ndrily.\n\nThe host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned\nwith a steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water\ninto Mr. Bumble`s eyes.\n\n`Now listen to me,` said the stranger, after closing the door and\nwindow.  `I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out;\nand, by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of\nhis friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was\nsitting in, while you were uppermost in my mind.  I want some\ninformation from you.  I don`t ask you to give it for nothing,\nslight as it is.  Put up that, to begin with.`\n\nAs he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to\nhis companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking\nof money should be heard without.  When Mr. Bumble had\nscrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine,\nand had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his\nwaistcoat-pocket, he went on:\n\n`Carry your memory back--let me see--twelve years, last winter.`\n\n`It`s a long time,` said Mr. Bumble.  `Very good.  I`ve done it.`\n\n`The scene, the workhouse.`\n\n`Good!`\n\n`And the time, night.`\n\n`Yes.`\n\n`And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which\nmiserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied\nto themselves--gave birth to puling children for the parish to\nrear; and hid their shame, rot `em in the grave!`\n\n`The lying-in room, I suppose?` said Mr. Bumble, not quite\nfollowing the stranger`s excited description.\n\n`Yes,` said the stranger.  `A boy was born there.`\n\n`A many boys,` observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head,\ndespondingly.\n\n`A murrain on the young devils!` cried the stranger; `I speak of\none; a meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down\nhere, to a coffin-maker--I wish he had made his coffin, and\nscrewed his body in it--and who afterwards ran away to London, as\nit was supposed.\n\n`Why, you mean Oliver!  Young Twist!` said Mr. Bumble; `I\nremember him, of course.  There wasn`t a obstinater young\nrascal--`\n\n`It`s not of him I want to hear; I`ve heard enough of him,` said\nthe stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on\nthe subject of poor Oliver`s vices.  `It`s of a woman; the hag\nthat nursed his mother.  Where is she?`\n\n`Where is she?` said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had\nrendered facetious.  `It would be hard to tell.  There`s no\nmidwifery there, whichever place she`s gone to; so I suppose\nshe`s out of employment, anyway.`\n\n`What do you mean?` demanded the stranger, sternly.\n\n`That she died last winter,` rejoined Mr. Bumble.\n\nThe man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information,\nand although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time\nafterwards, his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and\nhe seemed lost in thought.  For some time, he appeared doubtful\nwhether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the\nintelligence; but at length he breathed more freely; and\nwithdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great matter.\nWith that he rose, as if to depart.\n\nBut Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an\nopportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret\nin the possession of his better half.  He well remembered the\nnight of old Sally`s death, which the occurrences of that day had\ngiven him good reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he\nhad proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady had never\nconfided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary\nwitness, he had heard enough to know that it related to something\nthat had occurred in the old woman`s attendance, as workhouse\nnurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist.  Hastily calling\nthis circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger, with an air\nof mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old\nharridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had\nreason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his\ninquiry.\n\n`How can I find her?` said the stranger, thrown off his guard;\nand plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were\naroused afresh by the intelligence.\n\n`Only through me,` rejoined Mr. Bumble.\n\n`When?` cried the stranger, hastily.\n\n`To-morrow,` rejoined Bumble.\n\n`At nine in the evening,` said the stranger, producing a scrap of\npaper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the\nwater-side, in characters that betrayed his agitation; `at nine\nin the evening, bring her to me there.  I needn`t tell you to be\nsecret.  It`s your interest.`\n\nWith these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to\npay for the liquor that had been drunk.  Shortly remarking that\ntheir roads were different, he departed, without more ceremony\nthan an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the\nfollowing night.\n\nOn glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed\nthat it contained no name.  The stranger had not gone far, so he\nmade after him to ask it.\n\n`What do you want?` cried the man, turning quickly round, as\nBumble touched him on the arm.  `Following me?`\n\n`Only to ask a question,` said the other, pointing to the scrap\nof paper.  `What name am I to ask for?`\n\n`Monks!` rejoined the man; and strode hastily, away.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nCONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE,\nAND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW\n\nIt was a dull, close, overcast summer evening.  The clouds, which\nhad been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish\nmass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed\nto presage a violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble,\nturning out of the main street of the town, directed their course\ntowards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from\nit some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low\nunwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river.\n\nThey were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which\nmight, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their\npersons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation.  The\nhusband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet\nshone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though--the way\nbeing dirty--to give his wife the benefit of treading in his\nheavy footprints.  They went on, in profound silence; every now\nand then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if\nto make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering\nthat she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking,\nand proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their\nplace of destination.\n\nThis was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had\nlong been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who,\nunder various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted\nchiefly on plunder and crime.  It was a collection of mere\nhovels:  some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old\nworm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at\norder or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a\nfew feet of the river`s bank.  A few leaky boats drawn up on the\nmud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it:  and here\nand there an oar or coil of rope:  appeared, at first, to\nindicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued\nsome avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and\nuseless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led\na passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they\nwere disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances,\nthan with any view to their being actually employed.\n\nIn the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river,\nwhich its upper stories overhung; stood a large building,\nformerly used as a manufactory of some kind.  It had, in its day,\nprobably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the\nsurrounding tenements.  But it had long since gone to ruin.  The\nrat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and\nrotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of\nthe building had already sunk down into the water; while the\nremainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to\nwait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and\ninvolving itself in the same fate.\n\nIt was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple\npaused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the\nair, and the rain commenced pouring violently down.\n\n`The place should be somewhere here,` said Bumble, consulting a\nscrap of paper he held in his hand.\n\n`Halloa there!` cried a voice from above.\n\nFollowing the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a\nman looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.\n\n`Stand still, a minute,` cried the voice; `I`ll be with you\ndirectly.`  With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.\n\n`Is that the man?` asked Mr. Bumble`s good lady.\n\nMr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.\n\n`Then, mind what I told you,` said the matron: `and be careful to\nsay as little as you can, or you`ll betray us at once.`\n\nMr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was\napparently about to express some doubts relative to the\nadvisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just\nthen, when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks: who\nopened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them\ninwards.\n\n`Come in!` he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the\nground.  `Don`t keep me here!`\n\nThe woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without\nany other invitation.  Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to\nlag behind, followed:  obviously very ill at ease and with\nscarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his\nchief characteristic.\n\n`What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?` said\nMonks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted\nthe door behind them.\n\n`We--we were only cooling ourselves,` stammered Bumble, looking\napprehensively about him.\n\n`Cooling yourselves!` retorted Monks.  `Not all the rain that\never fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell`s fire\nout, as a man can carry about with him.  You won`t cool yourself\nso easily; don`t think it!`\n\nWith this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron,\nand bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily\ncowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards\nthe ground.\n\n`This is the woman, is it?` demanded Monks.\n\n`Hem!  That is the woman,` replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his\nwife`s caution.\n\n`You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?` said the\nmatron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching\nlook of Monks.\n\n`I know they will always keep _one_ till it`s found out,` said\nMonks.\n\n`And what may that be?` asked the matron.\n\n`The loss of their own good name,` replied Monks.  `So, by the\nsame rule, if a woman`s a party to a secret that might hang or\ntransport her, I`m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not\nI!  Do you understand, mistress?`\n\n`No,` rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.\n\n`Of course you don`t!` said Monks.  `How should you?`\n\nBestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his\ntwo companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man\nhastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent,\nbut low in the roof.  He was preparing to ascend a steep\nstaircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of\nwarehouses above:  when a bright flash of lightning streamed down\nthe aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the\ncrazy building to its centre.\n\n`Hear it!` he cried, shrinking back.  `Hear it!  Rolling and\ncrashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the\ndevils were hiding from it.  I hate the sound!`\n\nHe remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his\nhands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable\ndiscomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it was much distorted and\ndiscoloured.\n\n`These fits come over me, now and then,` said Monks, observing\nhis alarm; `and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don`t mind me\nnow; it`s all over for this once.`\n\nThus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing\nthe window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a\nlantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through\none of the heavy beams in the ceiling:  and which cast a dim\nlight upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath\nit.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Now,` said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves,\n`the sooner we come to our business, the better for all.  The\nwoman know what it is, does she?`\n\nThe question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated\nthe reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with\nit.\n\n`He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she\ndied; and that she told you something--`\n\n`About the mother of the boy you named,` replied the matron\ninterrupting him.  `Yes.`\n\n`The first question is, of what nature was her communication?`\nsaid Monks.\n\n`That`s the second,` observed the woman with much deliberation.\n`The first is, what may the communication be worth?`\n\n`Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it\nis?` asked Monks.\n\n`Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,` answered Mrs. Bumble:\nwho did not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly\ntestify.\n\n`Humph!` said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager\ninquiry; `there may be money`s worth to get, eh?`\n\n`Perhaps there may,` was the composed reply.\n\n`Something that was taken from her,` said Monks.  `Something that\nshe wore.  Something that--`\n\n`You had better bid,` interrupted Mrs. Bumble.  `I have heard\nenough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to\ntalk to.`\n\nMr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into\nany greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed,\nlistened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended\neyes:  which he directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in\nundisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter\nsternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure.\n\n`What`s it worth to you?` asked the woman, as collectedly as\nbefore.\n\n`It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,` replied Monks.\n`Speak out, and let me know which.`\n\n`Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me\nfive-and-twenty pounds in gold,` said the woman; `and I`ll tell\nyou all I know.  Not before.`\n\n`Five-and-twenty pounds!` exclaimed Monks, drawing back.\n\n`I spoke as plainly as I could,` replied Mrs. Bumble.  `It`s not\na large sum, either.`\n\n`Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when\nit`s told!` cried Monks impatiently; `and which has been lying\ndead for twelve years past or more!`\n\n`Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their\nvalue in course of time,` answered the matron, still preserving\nthe resolute indifference she had assumed.  `As to lying dead,\nthere are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to\ncome, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will\ntell strange tales at last!`\n\n`What if I pay it for nothing?` asked Monks, hesitating.\n\n`You can easily take it away again,` replied the matron. `I am\nbut a woman; alone here; and unprotected.`\n\n`Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,` submitted Mr.\nBumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: `_I_ am here, my dear.\nAnd besides,` said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke,\n`Mr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on\nporochial persons.  Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man,\nmy dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say;\nbu he has heerd:  I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my\ndear:  that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon\nstrength, if I`m once roused.  I only want a little rousing;\nthat`s all.`\n\nAs Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his\nlantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the\nalarmed expression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little\nrousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike\ndemonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person\nor persons trained down for the purpose.\n\n`You are a fool,` said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; `and had better\nhold your tongue.`\n\n`He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can`t speak\nin a lower tone,` said Monks, grimly.  `So!  He`s your husband,\neh?`\n\n`He my husband!` tittered the matron, parrying the question.\n\n`I thought as much, when you came in,` rejoined Monks, marking\nthe angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she\nspoke.  `So much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing\nwith two people, when I find that there`s only one will between\nthem.  I`m in earnest.  See here!`\n\nHe thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas\nbag, told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed\nthem over to the woman.\n\n`Now,` he said, `gather them up; and when this cursed peal of\nthunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top,\nis gone, let`s hear your story.`\n\nThe thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and\nbreak almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising\nhis face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman\nshould say.  The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two\nmen leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and\nthe woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible.  The\nsickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them,\naggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which,\nencircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in\nthe extreme.\n\n`When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,` the matron\nbegan, `she and I were alone.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Was there no one by?` asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper;\n`No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed?  No one who could\nhear, and might, by possibility, understand?`\n\n`Not a soul,` replied the woman; `we were alone.  _I_ stood alone\nbeside the body when death came over it.`\n\n`Good,` said Monks, regarding her attentively.  `Go on.`\n\n`She spoke of a young creature,` resumed the matron, `who had\nbrought a child into the world some years before; not merely in\nthe same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.`\n\n`Ay?` said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his\nshoulder, `Blood!  How things come about!`\n\n`The child was the one you named to him last night,` said the\nmatron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; `the mother this\nnurse had robbed.`\n\n`In life?` asked Monks.\n\n`In death,` replied the woman, with something like a shudder.\n`She stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one,\nthat which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath,\nto keep for the infant`s sake.`\n\n`She sold it,` cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; `did she\nsell it?  Where?  When?  To whom?  How long before?`\n\n`As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,`\nsaid the matron, `she fell back and died.`\n\n`Without saying more?` cried Monks, in a voice which, from its\nvery suppression, seemed only the more furious.  `It`s a lie!\nI`ll not be played with.  She said more.  I`ll tear the life out\nof you both, but I`ll know what it was.`\n\n`She didn`t utter another word,` said the woman, to all\nappearance unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the\nstrange man`s violence; `but she clutched my gown, violently,\nwith one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she\nwas dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a\nscrap of dirty paper.`\n\n`Which contained--` interposed Monks, stretching forward.\n\n`Nothing,` replied the woman; `it was a pawnbroker`s duplicate.`\n\n`For what?` demanded Monks.\n\n`In good time I`ll tell you.` said the woman.  `I judge that she\nhad kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to\nbetter account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped\ntogether money to pay the pawnbroker`s interest year by year, and\nprevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could\nstill be redeemed.  Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you,\nshe died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her\nhand.  The time was out in two days; I thought something might\none day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.`\n\n`Where is it now?` asked Monks quickly.\n\n`_There_,` replied the woman.  And, as if glad to be relieved of\nit, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely\nlarge enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore\nopen with trembling hands.  It contained a little gold locket:\nin which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.\n\n`It has the word \"Agnes\" engraved on the inside,` said the woman.\n\n`There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the\ndate; which is within a year before the child was born.  I found\nout that.`\n\n`And this is all?` said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny\nof the contents of the little packet.\n\n`All,` replied the woman.\n\nMr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that\nthe story was over, and no mention made of taking the\nfive-and-twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to\nwipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose,\nunchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue.\n\n`I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,` said\nhis wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; `and I want to\nknow nothing; for it`s safer not.  But I may ask you two\nquestions, may I?`\n\n`You may ask,` said Monks, with some show of surprise; `but\nwhether I answer or not is another question.`\n\n`--Which makes three,` observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of\nfacetiousness.\n\n`Is that what you expected to get from me?` demanded the matron.\n\n`It is,` replied Monks.  `The other question?`\n\n`What do you propose to do with it?  Can it be used against me?`\n\n`Never,` rejoined Monks; `nor against me either.  See here!  But\ndon`t move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.`\n"}

{"text":"\nWith these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and\npulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large\ntrap-door which opened close at Mr. Bumble`s feet, and caused\nthat gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great\nprecipitation.\n\n`Look down,` said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf.\n`Don`t fear me.  I could have let you down, quietly enough, when\nyou were seated over it, if that had been my game.`\n\nThus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr.\nBumble himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same.\nThe turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly\non below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its\nplashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles.  There\nhad once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing\nround the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet\nremained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed\nfrom the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its\nheadlong course.\n\n`If you flung a man`s body down there, where would it be\nto-morrow morning?` said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro\nin the dark well.\n\n`Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,` replied\nBumble, recoiling at the thought.\n\nMonks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had\nhurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had\nformed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped\nit into the stream.  It fell straight, and true as a die; clove\nthe water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone.\n\nThe three looking into each other`s faces, seemed to breathe more\nfreely.\n\n`There!` said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily\nback into its former position.  `If the sea ever gives up its\ndead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to\nitself, and that trash among it.  We have nothing more to say,\nand may break up our pleasant party.`\n\n`By all means,` observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.\n\n`You`ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?` said Monks,\nwith a threatening look.  `I am not afraid of your wife.`\n\n`You may depend upon me, young man,` answered Mr. Bumble, bowing\nhimself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness.\n`On everybody`s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr.\nMonks.`\n\n`I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,` remarked Monks. `Light\nyour lantern!  And get away from here as fast as you can.`\n\nIt was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point,\nor Mr. Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the\nladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room\nbelow.  He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached\nfrom the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort\nto prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his\nwife.  Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to\nsatisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than\nthe beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water.\n\nThey traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for\nMonks started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his\nlantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable\ncare, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his\nfigure:  looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors.  The\ngate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened\nby Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious\nacquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and\ndarkness outside.\n\nThey were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain\nan invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who\nhad been hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear\nthe light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nINTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS\nALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR\nWORTHY HEADS TOGETHER\n\nOn the evening following that upon which the three worthies\nmentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of\nbusiness as therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a\nnap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.\n\nThe room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one\nof those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition,\nalthough it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated\nat no great distance from his former lodgings.  It was not, in\nappearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters:  being\na mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size;\nlighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and\nabutting on a close and dirty lane.  Nor were there wanting other\nindications of the good gentleman`s having gone down in the world\nof late:  for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of\ncomfort, together with the disappearance of all such small\nmoveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme\npoverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes\nhimself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had\nstood in any need of corroboration.\n\nThe housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white\ngreat-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of\nfeatures in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness,\nand the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard\nof a week`s growth.  The dog sat at the bedside:  now eyeing his\nmaster with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and\nuttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower\npart of the house, attracted his attention.  Seated by the\nwindow, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed\na portion of the robber`s ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale\nand reduced with watching and privation, that there would have\nbeen considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy\nwho has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which\nshe replied to Mr. Sikes`s question.\n\n`Not long gone seven,` said the girl.  `How do you feel to-night,\nBill?`\n\n`As weak as water,` replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his\neyes and limbs.  `Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this\nthundering bed anyhow.`\n\nIllness had not improved Mr. Sikes`s temper; for, as the girl\nraised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses\non her awkwardness, and struck her.\n\n`Whining are you?` said Sikes.  `Come!  Don`t stand snivelling\nthere.  If you can`t do anything better than that, cut off\naltogether.  D`ye hear me?`\n\n`I hear you,` replied the girl, turning her face aside, and\nforcing a laugh.  `What fancy have you got in your head now?`\n\n`Oh! you`ve thought better of it, have you?` growled Sikes,\nmarking the tear which trembled in her eye.  `All the better for\nyou, you have.`\n\n`Why, you don`t mean to say, you`d be hard upon me to-night,\nBill,` said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.\n\n`No!` cried Mr. Sikes.  `Why not?`\n\n`Such a number of nights,` said the girl, with a touch of woman`s\ntenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone,\neven to her voice: `such a number of nights as I`ve been patient\nwith you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child:\nand this the first that I`ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn`t\nhave served me as you did just now, if you`d thought of that,\nwould you?  Come, come; say you wouldn`t.`\n\n`Well, then,` rejoined Mr. Sikes, `I wouldn`t.  Why, damme, now,\nthe girls`s whining again!`\n\n`It`s nothing,` said the girl, throwing herself into a chair.\n`Don`t you seem to mind me.  It`ll soon be over.`\n\n`What`ll be over?` demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. `What\nfoolery are you up to, now, again?  Get up and bustle about, and\ndon`t come over me with your woman`s nonsense.`\n\nAt any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it\nwas delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl\nbeing really weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back\nof the chair, and fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few\nof the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he was\naccustomed to garnish his threats.  Not knowing, very well, what\nto do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy`s hysterics\nwere usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and\nstruggles out of, without much assistance; Mr. Sikes tried a\nlittle blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly\nineffectual, called for assistance.\n\n`What`s the matter here, my dear?` said Fagin, looking in.\n\n`Lend a hand to the girl, can`t you?` replied Sikes impatiently.\n`Don`t stand chattering and grinning at me!`\n\nWith an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl`s\nassistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger),\nwho had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily\ndeposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and\nsnatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who\ncame close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his\nteeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient`s\nthroat:  previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes.\n\n`Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,` said\nMr. Dawkins; `and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes\nthe petticuts.`\n\nThese united restoratives, administered with great energy:\nespecially that department consigned to Master Bates, who\nappeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of\nunexampled pleasantry:  were not long in producing the desired\neffect.  The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering\nto a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow:  leaving\nMr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at\ntheir unlooked-for appearance.\n\n`Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?` he asked Fagin.\n\n`No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any\ngood; and I`ve brought something good with me, that you`ll be\nglad to see.  Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the\nlittle trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.`\n\nIn compliance with Mr. Fagin`s request, the Artful untied this\nbundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old\ntable-cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to\nCharley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various\nencomiums on their rarity and excellence.\n\n`Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,` exclaimed that young gentleman,\ndisclosing to view a huge pasty; `sitch delicate creeturs, with\nsitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth,\nand there`s no occasion to pick `em; half a pound of seven and\nsix-penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with\nbiling water, it`ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a\npound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn`t work at\nall at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,--oh\nno!  Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of\ndouble Glo`ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort\nyou ever lushed!`\n"}

{"text":"\nUttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of\nhis extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully\ncorked; while Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a\nwine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried:  which\nthe invalid tossed down his throat without a moment`s hesitation.\n\n`Ah!` said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction.\n`You`ll do, Bill; you`ll do now.`\n\n`Do!` exclaimed Mr. Sikes; `I might have been done for, twenty\ntimes over, afore you`d have done anything to help me.  What do\nyou mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more,\nyou false-hearted wagabond?`\n\n`Only hear him, boys!` said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. `And\nus come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.`\n\n`The things is well enough in their way,` observed Mr. Sikes:  a\nlittle soothed as he glanced over the table; `but what have you\ngot to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in\nthe mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more\nnotice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that `ere\ndog.--Drive him down, Charley!`\n\n`I never see such a jolly dog as that,` cried Master Bates, doing\nas he was desired.  `Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to\nmarket!  He`d make his fortun` on the stage that dog would, and\nrewive the drayma besides.`\n\n`Hold your din,` cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed:\nstill growling angrily.  `What have you got to say for yourself,\nyou withered old fence, eh?`\n\n`I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,`\nreplied the Jew.\n\n`And what about the other fortnight?` demanded Sikes.  `What\nabout the other fortnight that you`ve left me lying here, like a\nsick rat in his hole?`\n\n`I couldn`t help it, Bill.  I can`t go into a long explanation\nbefore company; but I couldn`t help it, upon my honour.`\n\n`Upon your what?` growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. `Here!\nCut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the\ntaste of that out of my mouth, or it`ll choke me dead.`\n\n`Don`t be out of temper, my dear,` urged Fagin, submissively. `I\nhave never forgot you, Bill; never once.`\n\n`No!  I`ll pound it that you han`t,` replied Sikes, with a bitter\ngrin.  `You`ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I\nhave laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this;\nand Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap,\nas soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work.\nIf it hadn`t been for the girl, I might have died.`\n\n`There now, Bill,` remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the\nword.  `If it hadn`t been for the girl!  Who but poor ould Fagin\nwas the means of your having such a handy girl about you?`\n\n`He says true enough there!` said Nancy, coming hastily forward.\n`Let him be; let him be.`\n\nNancy`s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the\nboys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply\nher with liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly;\nwhile Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually\nbrought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard\nhis threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by\nlaughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after\nrepeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he condescended to\nmake.\n\n`It`s all very well,` said Mr. Sikes; `but I must have some blunt\nfrom you to-night.`\n\n`I haven`t a piece of coin about me,` replied the Jew.\n\n`Then you`ve got lots at home,` retorted Sikes; `and I must have\nsome from there.`\n\n`Lots!` cried Fagin, holding up is hands.  `I haven`t so much as\nwould--`\n\n`I don`t know how much you`ve got, and I dare say you hardly know\nyourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,` said\nSikes; `but I must have some to-night; and that`s flat.`\n\n`Well, well,` said Fagin, with a sigh, `I`ll send the Artful\nround presently.`\n\n`You won`t do nothing of the kind,` rejoined Mr. Sikes. `The\nArtful`s a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his\nway, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for\nan excuse, if you put him up to it.  Nancy shall go to the ken\nand fetch it, to make all sure; and I`ll lie down and have a\nsnooze while she`s gone.`\n\nAfter a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down\nthe amount of the required advance from five pounds to three\npounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn\nasseverations that that would only leave him eighteen-pence to\nkeep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn`t\nget any more he must accompany him home; with the Dodger and\nMaster Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.  The Jew then,\ntaking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,\nattended by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging\nhimself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time\nuntil the young lady`s return.\n\nIn due course, they arrived at Fagin`s abode, where they found\nToby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at\ncribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter\ngentleman lost, and with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence:\nmuch to the amusement of his young friends.  Mr. Crackit,\napparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with\na gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental\nendowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to\ngo.\n\n`Has nobody been, Toby?` asked Fagin.\n"}

Horrid dull, I`m blessed if I an`t!`\n\nWith these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby\nCrackit swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his\nwaistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces\nof silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his\nfigure; this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much\nelegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous\nadmiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of\nsight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance\ncheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he didn`t value\nhis losses the snap of his little finger.\n\n`Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!` said Master Bates, highly amused\nby this declaration.\n\n`Not a bit of it,` replied Mr. Chitling.  `Am I, Fagin?`\n\n`A very clever fellow, my dear,` said Fagin, patting him on the\nshoulder, and winking to his other pupils.\n\n`And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an`t he, Fagin?` asked Tom.\n\n`No doubt at all of that, my dear.`\n\n`And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an`t it,\nFagin?` pursued Tom.\n\n`Very much so, indeed, my dear.

But I can go and earn some more, when I like;\ncan`t I, Fagin?`\n\n`To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so\nmake up your loss at once, and don`t lose any more time.  Dodger!\nCharley!  It`s time you were on the lay.  Come!  It`s near ten,\nand nothing done yet.`\n\nIn obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up\ntheir hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious\nfriend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense\nof Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say,\nthere was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar:  inasmuch as\nthere are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who\npay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good\nsociety:  and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the\ngood society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon\nvery much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.\n\n`Now,` said Fagin, when they had left the room, `I`ll go and get\nyou that cash, Nancy.  This is only the key of a little cupboard\nwhere I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear.  I never\nlock up my money, for I`ve got none to lock up, my dear--ha! ha!\nha!--none to lock up.  It`s a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks;\nbut I`m fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it\nall, I bear it all.  Hush!` he said, hastily concealing the key\nin his breast; `who`s that?  Listen!`\n\nThe girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded,\nappeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether\nthe person, whoever he was, came or went:  until the murmur of a\nman`s voice reached her ears.  The instant she caught the sound,\nshe tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of\nlightning, and thrust them under the table. The Jew, turning\nround immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the\nheat:  in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably,\nwith the extreme haste and violence of this action:  which,\nhowever, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards\nher at the time.\n\n`Bah!` he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; `it`s\nthe man I expected before; he`s coming downstairs.  Not a word\nabout the money while he`s here, Nance.  He won`t stop long.  Not\nten minutes, my dear.`\n\nLaying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a\ncandle to the door, as a man`s step was heard upon the stairs\nwithout.  He reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who,\ncoming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he\nobserved her.\n\nIt was Monks.\n\n`Only one of my young people,` said Fagin, observing that Monks\ndrew back, on beholding a stranger.  `Don`t move, Nancy.`\n\nThe girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an\nair of careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned\ntowards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and\nfull of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe\nthe change, he could hardly have believed the two looks to have\nproceeded from the same person.\n\n`Any news?` inquired Fagin.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Great.`\n\n`And--and--good?` asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to\nvex the other man by being too sanguine.\n\n`Not bad, any way,` replied Monks with a smile.  `I have been\nprompt enough this time.  Let me have a word with you.`\n\nThe girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the\nroom, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her.  The\nJew:  perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the\nmoney, if he endeavoured to get rid of her:  pointed upward, and\ntook Monks out of the room.\n\n`Not that infernal hole we were in before,` she could hear the\nman say as they went upstairs.  Fagin laughed; and making some\nreply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the\nboards, to lead his companion to the second story.\n\nBefore the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through\nthe house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her\ngown loosely over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at\nthe door, listening with breathless interest.  The moment the\nnoise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with\nincredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above.\n\nThe room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the\ngirl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately\nafterwards, the two men were heard descending.  Monks went at\nonce into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the\nmoney.  When he returned, the girl was adjusting her shawl and\nbonnet, as if preparing to be gone.\n\n`Why, Nance!` exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down\nthe candle, `how pale you are!`\n\n`Pale!` echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if\nto look steadily at him.\n\n`Quite horrible.  What have you been doing to yourself?`\n\n`Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I\ndon`t know how long and all,` replied the girl carelessly.\n`Come!  Let me get back; that`s a dear.`\n\nWith a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into\nher hand.  They parted without more conversation, merely\ninterchanging a `good-night.`\n\nWhen the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a\ndoorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and\nunable to pursue her way.  Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on,\nin a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting\nher returned, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved\ninto a violent run.  After completely exhausting herself, she\nstopped to take breath:  and, as if suddenly recollecting\nherself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent\nupon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.\n\nIt might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the\nfull hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and\nhurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction;\npartly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the\nviolent current of her own thoughts:  soon reached the dwelling\nwhere she had left the housebreaker.\n\nIf she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr.\nSikes, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had\nbrought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he\nuttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the\npillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.\n\nIt was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned\nhim so much employment next day in the way of eating and\ndrinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing\ndown the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor\ninclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and\ndeportment.  That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner\nof one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which\nit has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have\nbeen obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have\ntaken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of\ndiscrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings\nthan those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of\nbehaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an\nunusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw\nnothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so\nlittle about her, that, had her agitation been far more\nperceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have\nawakened his suspicions.\n\nAs that day closed in, the girl`s excitement increased; and, when\nnight came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker\nshould drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her\ncheek, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with\nastonishment.\n\nMr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot\nwater with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed\nhis glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth\ntime, when these symptoms first struck him.\n\n`Why, burn my body!` said the man, raising himself on his hands\nas he stared the girl in the face.  `You look like a corpse come\nto life again.  What`s the matter?`\n\n`Matter!` replied the girl.  `Nothing.  What do you look at me so\nhard for?`\n\n`What foolery is this?` demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm,\nand shaking her roughly.  `What is it?  What do you mean?  What\nare you thinking of?`\n\n`Of many things, Bill,` replied the girl, shivering, and as she\ndid so, pressing her hands upon her eyes.  `But, Lord!  What odds\nin that?`\n\nThe tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken,\nseemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and\nrigid look which had preceded them.\n\n`I tell you wot it is,` said Sikes; `if you haven`t caught the\nfever, and got it comin` on, now, there`s something more than\nusual in the wind, and something dangerous too.  You`re not\na-going to--.  No, damme! you wouldn`t do that!`\n\n`Do what?` asked the girl.\n\n`There ain`t,` said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and\nmuttering the words to himself; `there ain`t a stauncher-hearted\ngal going, or I`d have cut her throat three months ago.  She`s\ngot the fever coming on; that`s it.`\n\nFortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass\nto the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for\nhis physic.  The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it\nquickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel\nto his lips, while he drank off the contents.\n\n`Now,` said the robber, `come and sit aside of me, and put on\nyour own face; or I`ll alter it so, that you won`t know it agin\nwhen you do want it.`\n\nThe girl obeyed.  Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon\nthe pillow: turning his eyes upon her face.  They closed; opened\nagain; closed once more; again opened.  He shifted his position\nrestlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three\nminutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and\ngazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were,\nwhile in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy\nsleep.  The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell\nlanguidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance.\n\n`The laudanum has taken effect at last,` murmured the girl, as\nshe rose from the bedside.  `I may be too late, even now.`\n\nShe hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl:  looking\nfearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping\ndraught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of\nSikes`s heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over\nthe bed, she kissed the robber`s lips; and then opening and\nclosing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the\nhouse.\n\nA watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through\nwhich she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.\n\n`Has it long gone the half-hour?` asked the girl.\n\n`It`ll strike the hour in another quarter,` said the man:\nraising his lantern to her face.\n\n`And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,` muttered\nNancy:  brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the\nstreet.\n"}

{"text":"\nMany of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and\navenues through which she tracked her way, in making from\nSpitalfields towards the West-End of London.  The clock struck\nten, increasing her impatience.  She tore along the narrow\npavement:  elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting\nalmost under the horses` heads, crossed crowded streets, where\nclusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do\nthe like.\n\n`The woman is mad!` said the people, turning to look after her as\nshe rushed away.\n\nWhen she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the\nstreets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong\nprogress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom\nshe hurried past.  Some quickened their pace behind, as though to\nsee whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few\nmade head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her\nundiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she\nneared her place of destination, she was alone.\n\nIt was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde\nPark.  As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its\ndoor, guided her to the spot, the clock struck eleven.  She had\nloitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her\nmind to advance; but the sound determined her, and she stepped\ninto the hall.  The porter`s seat was vacant.  She looked round\nwith an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs.\n\n`Now, young woman!` said a smartly-dressed female, looking out\nfrom a door behind her, `who do you want here?`\n\n`A lady who is stopping in this house,` answered the girl.\n\n`A lady!` was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. `What\nlady?`\n\n`Miss Maylie,` said Nancy.\n\nThe young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance,\nreplied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to\nanswer her.  To him, Nancy repeated her request.\n\n`What name am I to say?` asked the waiter.\n\n`It`s of no use saying any,` replied Nancy.\n\n`Nor business?` said the man.\n\n`No, nor that neither,` rejoined the girl.  `I must see the\nlady.`\n\n`Come!` said the man, pushing her towards the door.  `None of\nthis.  Take yourself off.`\n\n`I shall be carried out if I go!` said the girl violently; `and I\ncan make that a job that two of you won`t like to do.  Isn`t\nthere anybody here,` she said, looking round, `that will see a\nsimple message carried for a poor wretch like me?`\n\nThis appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook,\nwho with some of the other servants was looking on, and who\nstepped forward to interfere.\n\n`Take it up for her, Joe; can`t you?` said this person.\n\n`What`s the good?` replied the man.  `You don`t suppose the young\nlady will see such as her; do you?`\n\nThis allusion to Nancy`s doubtful character, raised a vast\nquantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who\nremarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to\nher sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly,\ninto the kennel.\n\n`Do what you like with me,` said the girl, turning to the men\nagain; `but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this\nmessage for God Almighty`s sake.`\n\nThe soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was\nthat the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.\n\n`What`s it to be?` said the man, with one foot on the stairs.\n\n`That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie\nalone,` said Nancy; `and that if the lady will only hear the\nfirst word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her\nbusiness, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.`\n\n`I say,` said the man, `you`re coming it strong!`\n\n`You give the message,` said the girl firmly; `and let me hear\nthe answer.`\n\nThe man ran upstairs.  Nancy remained, pale and almost\nbreathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible\nexpressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very\nprolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man\nreturned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs.\n\n`It`s no good being proper in this world,` said the first\nhousemaid.\n\n`Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,` said\nthe second.\n\nThe third contented herself with wondering `what ladies was made\nof`; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of `Shameful!`\nwith which the Dianas concluded.\n\nRegardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart:\nNancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small\nante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left\nher, and retired.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XL\n\nA STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER\n\nThe girl`s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the\nmost noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was\nsomething of the woman`s original nature left in her still; and\nwhen she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that\nby which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which\nthe small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened\nwith the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she\ncould scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought\nthis interview.\n\nBut struggling with these better feelings was pride,--the vice of\nthe lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high\nand self-assured.  The miserable companion of thieves and\nruffians, the fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the\nscourings of the jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the\ngallows itself,--even this degraded being felt too proud to\nbetray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a\nweakness, but which alone connected her with that humanity, of\nwhich her wasting life had obliterated so many, many traces when\na very child.\n\nShe raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which\npresented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then,\nbending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected\ncarelessness as she said:\n\n`It`s a hard matter to get to see you, lady.  If I had taken\noffence, and gone away, as many would have done, you`d have been\nsorry for it one day, and not without reason either.`\n\n`I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,` replied\nRose.  `Do not think of that.  Tell me why you wished to see me.\nI am the person you inquired for.`\n\nThe kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner,\nthe absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the\ngirl completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.\n\n`Oh, lady, lady!` she said, clasping her hands passionately\nbefore her face, `if there was more like you, there would be\nfewer like me,--there would--there would!`\n\n`Sit down,` said Rose, earnestly.  `If you are in poverty or\naffliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,--I\nshall indeed.  Sit down.`\n\n`Let me stand, lady,` said the girl, still weeping, `and do not\nspeak to me so kindly till you know me better.  It is growing\nlate.  Is--is--that door shut?`\n\n`Yes,` said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer\nassistance in case she should require it.  `Why?`\n\n`Because,` said the girl, `I am about to put my life and the\nlives of others in your hands.  I am the girl that dragged little\nOliver back to old Fagin`s on the night he went out from the\nhouse in Pentonville.`\n\n`You!` said Rose Maylie.\n\n`I, lady!` replied the girl.  `I am the infamous creature you\nhave heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from\nthe first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on\nLondon streets have known any better life, or kinder words than\nthey have given me, so help me God!  Do not mind shrinking openly\nfrom me, lady.  I am younger than you would think, to look at me,\nbut I am well used to it. The poorest women fall back, as I make\nmy way along the crowded pavement.`\n\n`What dreadful things are these!` said Rose, involuntarily\nfalling from her strange companion.\n\n`Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,` cried the girl, `that\nyou had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and\nthat you were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and\ndrunkenness, and--and--something worse than all--as I have been\nfrom my cradle.  I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter\nwere mine, as they will be my deathbed.`\n\n`I pity you!` said Rose, in a broken voice.  `It wrings my heart\nto hear you!`\n\n`Heaven bless you for your goodness!` rejoined the girl. `If you\nknew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have\nstolen away from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I\nhad been here, to tell you what I have overheard.  Do you know a\nman named Monks?`\n\n`No,` said Rose.\n\n`He knows you,` replied the girl; `and knew you were here, for it\nwas by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.`\n\n`I never heard the name,` said Rose.\n\n`Then he goes by some other amongst us,` rejoined the girl,\n`which I more than thought before.  Some time ago, and soon after\nOliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery,\nI--suspecting this man--listened to a conversation held between\nhim and Fagin in the dark.  I found out, from what I heard, that\nMonks--the man I asked you about, you know--`\n\n`Yes,` said Rose, `I understand.`\n\n`--That Monks,` pursued the girl, `had seen him accidently with\ntwo of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him\ndirectly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I\ncouldn`t make out why.  A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if\nOliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to\nhave more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for\nsome purpose of his own.`\n\n`For what purpose?` asked Rose.\n\n`He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the\nhope of finding out,` said the girl; `and there are not many\npeople besides me that could have got out of their way in time to\nescape discovery.  But I did; and I saw him no more till last\nnight.`\n\n`And what occurred then?`\n\n`I`ll tell you, lady.  Last night he came again.  Again they went\nupstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not\nbetray me, again listened at the door.  The first words I heard\nMonks say were these:  \"So the only proofs of the boy`s identity\nlie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received\nthem from the mother is rotting in her coffin.\"  They laughed,\nand talked of his success in doing this; and Monks, talking on\nabout the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had got\nthe young devil`s money safely now, he`d rather have had it the\nother way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought\ndown the boast of the father`s will, by driving him through every\njail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital felony\nwhich Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit\nof him besides.`\n\n`What is all this!` said Rose.\n\n`The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,` replied the\ngirl.  `Then, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but\nstrange to yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking\nthe boy`s life without bringing his own neck in danger, he would;\nbut, as he couldn`t, he`d be upon the watch to meet him at every\nturn in life; and if he took advantage of his birth and history,\nhe might harm him yet. \"In short, Fagin,\" he says, \"Jew as you\nare, you never laid such snares as I`ll contrive for my young\nbrother, Oliver.\"`\n\n`His brother!` exclaimed Rose.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Those were his words,` said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as\nshe had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a\nvision of Sikes haunted her perpetually.  `And more. When he\nspoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed contrived by\nHeaven, or the devil, against him, that Oliver should come into\nyour hands, he laughed, and said there was some comfort in that\ntoo, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds\nwould you not give, if you had them, to know who your two-legged\nspaniel was.`\n\n`You do not mean,` said Rose, turning very pale, `to tell me that\nthis was said in earnest?`\n\n`He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,` replied\nthe girl, shaking her head.  `He is an earnest man when his\nhatred is up.  I know many who do worse things; but I`d rather\nlisten to them all a dozen times, than to that Monks once.  It is\ngrowing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of\nhaving been on such an errand as this.  I must get back quickly.`\n\n`But what can I do?` said Rose.  `To what use can I turn this\ncommunication without you?  Back!  Why do you wish to return to\ncompanions you paint in such terrible colors?  If you repeat this\ninformation to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from\nthe next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety\nwithout half an hour`s delay.`\n\n`I wish to go back,` said the girl.  `I must go back,\nbecause--how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like\nyou?--because among the men I have told you of, there is one:\nthe most desperate among them all; that I can`t leave:  no, not\neven to be saved from the life I am leading now.`\n\n`Your having interfered in this dear boy`s behalf before,` said\nRose; `your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you\nhave heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what\nyou say; your evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me\nto believe that you might yet be reclaimed.  Oh!` said the\nearnest girl, folding her hands as the tears coursed down her\nface, `do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your\nown sex; the first--the first, I do believe, who ever appealed to\nyou in the voice of pity and compassion.  Do hear my words, and\nlet me save you yet, for better things.`\n\n`Lady,` cried the girl, sinking on her knees, `dear, sweet, angel\nlady, you _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as\nthese, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned\nme from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too\nlate!`\n\n`It is never too late,` said Rose, `for penitence and atonement.`\n\n`It is,` cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; `I cannot\nleave him now!  I could not be his death.`\n\n`Why should you be?` asked Rose.\n\n`Nothing could save him,` cried the girl.  `If I told others what\nI have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure\nto die.  He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!`\n\n`Is it possible,` cried Rose, `that for such a man as this, you\ncan resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate\nrescue?  It is madness.`\n\n`I don`t know what it is,` answered the girl; `I only know that\nit is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as\nbad and wretched as myself.  I must go back.  Whether it is God`s\nwrath for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn\nback to him through every suffering and ill usage; and I should\nbe, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last.`\n\n`What am I to do?` said Rose.  `I should not let you depart from\nme thus.`\n\n`You should, lady, and I know you will,` rejoined the girl,\nrising.  `You will not stop my going because I have trusted in\nyour goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have\ndone.`\n\n`Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?` said\nRose.  `This mystery must be investigated, or how will its\ndisclosure to me, benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?`\n\n`You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as\na secret, and advise you what to do,` rejoined the girl.\n\n`But where can I find you again when it is necessary?` asked\nRose.  `I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live,\nbut where will you be walking or passing at any settled period\nfrom this time?`\n\n`Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept,\nand come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and\nthat I shall not be watched or followed?` asked the girl.\n\n`I promise you solemnly,` answered Rose.\n\n`Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,`\nsaid the girl without hesitation, `I will walk on London Bridge\nif I am alive.`\n\n`Stay another moment,` interposed Rose, as the girl moved\nhurriedly towards the door.  `Think once again on your own\ncondition, and the opportunity you have of escaping from it.  You\nhave a claim on me:  not only as the voluntary bearer of this\nintelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption.  Will\nyou return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word\ncan save you?  What fascination is it that can take you back, and\nmake you cling to wickedness and misery?  Oh! is there no chord\nin your heart that I can touch!  Is there nothing left, to which\nI can appeal against this terrible infatuation!`\n\n`When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,`\nreplied the girl steadily, `give away your hearts, love will\ncarry you all lengths--even such as you, who have home, friends,\nother admirers, everything, to fill them.  When such as I, who\nhave no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness\nor death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any\nman, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all\nour wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?  Pity us, lady--pity\nus for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having\nthat turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride,\ninto a new means of violence and suffering.`\n\n`You will,` said Rose, after a pause, `take some money from me,\nwhich may enable you to live without dishonesty--at all events\nuntil we meet again?`\n\n`Not a penny,` replied the girl, waving her hand.\n\n`Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,`\nsaid Rose, stepping gently forward.  `I wish to serve you\nindeed.`\n\n`You would serve me best, lady,` replied the girl, wringing her\nhands, `if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more\ngrief to think of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before,\nand it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have\nlived.  God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on\nyour head as I have brought shame on mine!`\n\nThus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned\naway; while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary\ninterview, which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an\nactual occurrence, sank into a chair, and endeavoured to collect\nher wandering thoughts.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nCONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE\nMISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE\n\nHer situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty.\nWhile she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the\nmystery in which Oliver`s history was enveloped, she could not\nbut hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with\nwhom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and\nguileless girl.  Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie`s\nheart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and\nscarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish\nto win the outcast back to repentance and hope.\n\nThey purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to\ndeparting for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.  It was\nnow midnight of the first day.  What course of action could she\ndetermine upon, which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours?\nOr how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion?\n\nMr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days;\nbut Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman`s\nimpetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the\nfirst explosion of his indignation, he would regard the\ninstrument of Oliver`s recapture, to trust him with the secret,\nwhen her representations in the girl`s behalf could be seconded\nby no experienced person.  These were all reasons for the\ngreatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating\nit to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to\nhold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject.  As to\nresorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do\nso, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason.  Once\nthe thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but\nthis awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it\nseemed unworthy of her to call him back, when--the tears rose to\nher eyes as she pursued this train of reflection--he might have\nby this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.\n\nDisturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one\ncourse and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each\nsuccessive consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose\npassed a sleepless and anxious night.  After more communing with\nherself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of\nconsulting Harry.\n\n`If it be painful to him,` she thought, `to come back here, how\npainful it will be to me!  But perhaps he will not come; he may\nwrite, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from\nmeeting me--he did when he went away.  I hardly thought he would;\nbut it was better for us both.`  And here Rose dropped the pen,\nand turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her\nmessenger should not see her weep.\n\nShe had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty\ntimes, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her\nletter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been\nwalking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered\nthe room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as\nseemed to betoken some new cause of alarm.\n\n`What makes you look so flurried?` asked Rose, advancing to meet\nhim.\n\n`I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,` replied the\nboy.  `Oh dear!  To think that I should see him at last, and you\nshould be able to know that I have told you the truth!`\n\n`I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,` said\nRose, soothing him.  `But what is this?--of whom do you speak?`\n\n`I have seen the gentleman,` replied Oliver, scarcely able to\narticulate, `the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow,\nthat we have so often talked about.`\n\n`Where?` asked Rose.\n\n`Getting out of a coach,` replied Oliver, shedding tears of\ndelight, `and going into a house.  I didn`t speak to him--I\ncouldn`t speak to him, for he didn`t see me, and I trembled so,\nthat I was not able to go up to him.  But Giles asked, for me,\nwhether he lived there, and they said he did.  Look here,` said\nOliver, opening a scrap of paper, `here it is; here`s where he\nlives--I`m going there directly!  Oh, dear me, dear me!  What\nshall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!`\n\nWith her attention not a little distracted by these and a great\nmany other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address,\nwhich was Craven Street, in the Strand.  She very soon determined\nupon turning the discovery to account.\n\n`Quick!` she said.  `Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be\nready to go with me.  I will take you there directly, without a\nminute`s loss of time.  I will only tell my aunt that we are\ngoing out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.`\n\nOliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than\nfive minutes they were on their way to Craven Street.  When they\narrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of\npreparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her\ncard by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very\npressing business.  The servant soon returned, to beg that she\nwould walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss\nMaylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent\nappearance, in a bottle-green coat.  At no great distance from\nwhom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and\ngaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was\nsitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and\nhis chin propped thereupon.\n\n`Dear me,` said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily\nrising with great politeness, `I beg your pardon, young lady--I\nimagined it was some importunate person who--I beg you will\nexcuse me.  Be seated, pray.`\n\n`Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?` said Rose, glancing from the\nother gentleman to the one who had spoken.\n\n`That is my name,` said the old gentleman.  `This is my friend,\nMr. Grimwig.  Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?`\n\n`I believe,` interposed Miss Maylie, `that at this period of our\ninterview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going\naway.  If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the\nbusiness on which I wish to speak to you.`\n\nMr. Brownlow inclined his head.  Mr. Grimwig, who had made one\nvery stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff\nbow, and dropped into it again.\n\n`I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,` said Rose,\nnaturally embarrassed; `but you once showed great benevolence and\ngoodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you\nwill take an interest in hearing of him again.`\n\n`Indeed!` said Mr. Brownlow.\n\n`Oliver Twist you knew him as,` replied Rose.\n\nThe words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had\nbeen affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table,\nupset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair,\ndischarged from his features every expression but one of\nunmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare;\nthen, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked\nhimself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude,\nand looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle,\nwhich seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to\ndie away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.\n\nMr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was\nnot expressed in the same eccentric manner.  He drew his chair\nnearer to Miss Maylie`s, and said,\n"}

{"text":"\n`Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of\nthe question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak,\nand of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in\nyour power to produce any evidence which will alter the\nunfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor\nchild, in Heaven`s name put me in possession of it.`\n\n`A bad one!  I`ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,` growled\nMr. Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving\na muscle of his face.\n\n`He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,` said Rose,\ncolouring; `and that Power which has thought fit to try him\nbeyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and\nfeelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days\nsix times over.`\n\n`I`m only sixty-one,` said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face.\n`And, as the devil`s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old\nat least, I don`t see the application of that remark.`\n\n`Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,` said Mr. Brownlow; `he does\nnot mean what he says.`\n\n`Yes, he does,` growled Mr. Grimwig.\n\n`No, he does not,` said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath\nas he spoke.\n\n`He`ll eat his head, if he doesn`t,` growled Mr. Grimwig.\n\n`He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,` said Mr.\nBrownlow.\n\n`And he`d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,`\nresponded Mr. Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.\n\nHaving gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff,\nand afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.\n\n`Now, Miss Maylie,` said Mr. Brownlow, `to return to the subject\nin which your humanity is so much interested.  Will you let me\nknow what intelligence you have of this poor child:  allowing me\nto promise that I exhausted every means in my power of\ndiscovering him, and that since I have been absent from this\ncountry, my first impression that he had imposed upon me, and had\nbeen persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been\nconsiderably shaken.`\n\nRose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related,\nin a few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he\nleft Mr. Brownlow`s house; reserving Nancy`s information for that\ngentleman`s private ear, and concluding with the assurance that\nhis only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to\nmeet with his former benefactor and friend.\n\n`Thank God!` said the old gentleman.  `This is great happiness to\nme, great happiness.  But you have not told me where he is now,\nMiss Maylie.  You must pardon my finding fault with you,--but why\nnot have brought him?`\n\n`He is waiting in a coach at the door,` replied Rose.\n\n`At this door!` cried the old gentleman.  With which he hurried\nout of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the\ncoach, without another word.\n\nWhen the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his\nhead, and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a\npivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of\nhis stick and the table; sitting in it all the time.  After\nperforming this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could\nup and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping\nsuddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface.\n\n`Hush!` he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this\nunusual proceeding.  `Don`t be afraid.  I`m old enough to be your\ngrandfather.  You`re a sweet girl.  I like you.  Here they are!`\n\nIn fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his\nformer seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom\nMr. Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of\nthat moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care\nin Oliver`s behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.\n\n`There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,`\nsaid Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell.  `Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if\nyou please.`\n\nThe old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and\ndropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.\n\n`Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,` said Mr. Brownlow,\nrather testily.\n\n`Well, that I do, sir,` replied the old lady.  `People`s eyes, at\nmy time of life, don`t improve with age, sir.`\n\n`I could have told you that,` rejoined Mr. Brownlow; `but put on\nyour glasses, and see if you can`t find out what you were wanted\nfor, will you?`\n\nThe old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles.\nBut Oliver`s patience was not proof against this new trial; and\nyielding to his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.\n\n`God be good to me!` cried the old lady, embracing him; `it is my\ninnocent boy!`\n\n`My dear old nurse!` cried Oliver.\n\n`He would come back--I knew he would,` said the old lady, holding\nhim in her arms.  `How well he looks, and how like a gentleman`s\nson he is dressed again!  Where have you been, this long, long\nwhile?  Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft\neye, but not so sad.  I have never forgotten them or his quiet\nsmile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of\nmy own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young\ncreature.`  Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her to\nmark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her\nfingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept\nupon his neck by turns.\n"}

{"text":"\nLeaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow\nled the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full\nnarration of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no\nlittle surprise and perplexity.  Rose also explained her reasons\nfor not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first\ninstance.  The old gentleman considered that she had acted\nprudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with\nthe worthy doctor himself.  To afford him an early opportunity\nfor the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should\ncall at the hotel at eight o`clock that evening, and that in the\nmeantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that\nhad occurred.  These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver\nreturned home.\n\nRose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor`s\nwrath.  Nancy`s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he\npoured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations;\nthreatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity\nof Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his hat\npreparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those\nworthies.  And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have\ncarried the intention into effect without a moment`s\nconsideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained,\nin part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow,\nwho was himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such\narguments and representations as seemed best calculated to\ndissuade him from his hotbrained purpose.\n\n`Then what the devil is to be done?` said the impetuous doctor,\nwhen they had rejoined the two ladies.  `Are we to pass a vote of\nthanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to\naccept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our\nesteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to\nOliver?`\n\n`Not exactly that,` rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; `but we must\nproceed gently and with great care.`\n\n`Gentleness and care,` exclaimed the doctor.  `I`d send them one\nand all to--`\n\n`Never mind where,` interposed Mr. Brownlow.  `But reflect\nwhether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we\nhave in view.`\n\n`What object?` asked the doctor.\n\n`Simply, the discovery of Oliver`s parentage, and regaining for\nhim the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been\nfraudulently deprived.`\n\n`Ah!` said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his\npocket-handkerchief; `I almost forgot that.`\n\n`You see,` pursued Mr. Brownlow; `placing this poor girl entirely\nout of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring\nthese scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what\ngood should we bring about?`\n\n`Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,` suggested\nthe doctor, `and transporting the rest.`\n\n`Very good,` replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; `but no doubt they\nwill bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and\nif we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be\nperforming a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own\ninterest--or at least to Oliver`s, which is the same thing.`\n\n`How?` inquired the doctor.\n\n`Thus.  It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty\nin getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring\nthis man, Monks, upon his knees.  That can only be done by\nstratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these\npeople.  For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof\nagainst him.  He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts\nappear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies.\nIf he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could\nreceive any further punishment than being committed to prison as\na rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth\nwould be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our\npurposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.`\n\n`Then,` said the doctor impetuously, `I put it to you again,\nwhether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl\nshould be considered binding; a promise made with the best and\nkindest intentions, but really--`\n\n`Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,` said Mr.\nBrownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. `The\npromise shall be kept.  I don`t think it will, in the slightest\ndegree, interfere with our proceedings.  But, before we can\nresolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary\nto see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out\nthis Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by\nus, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that,\nto procure from her such an account of his haunts and description\nof his person, as will enable us to identify him.  She cannot be\nseen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday.  I would suggest\nthat in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these\nmatters secret even from Oliver himself.`\n\nAlthough Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal\ninvolving a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that\nno better course occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and\nMrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that\ngentleman`s proposition was carried unanimously.\n\n`I should like,` he said, `to call in the aid of my friend\nGrimwig.  He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might\nprove of material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred\na lawyer, and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one\nbrief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether\nthat is recommendation or not, you must determine for\nyourselves.`\n\n`I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call\nin mine,` said the doctor.\n"}

{"text":"\n`We must put it to the vote,` replied Mr. Brownlow, `who may he\nbe?`\n\n`That lady`s son, and this young lady`s--very old friend,` said\nthe doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an\nexpressive glance at her niece.\n\nRose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection\nto this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and\nHarry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the\ncommittee.\n\n`We stay in town, of course,` said Mrs. Maylie, `while there\nremains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a\nchance of success.  I will spare neither trouble nor expense in\nbehalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested,\nand I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so\nlong as you assure me that any hope remains.`\n\n`Good!` rejoined Mr. Brownlow.  `And as I see on the faces about\nme, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in\nthe way to corroborate Oliver`s tale, and had so suddenly left\nthe kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions\nuntil such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by\ntelling my own story.  Believe me, I make this request with good\nreason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be\nrealised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments\nalready quite numerous enough.  Come!  Supper has been announced,\nand young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have\nbegun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his\ncompany, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him\nforth upon the world.`\n\nWith these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie,\nand escorted her into the supper-room.

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER`S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF\nGENIUS, BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS\n\nUpon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep,\nhurried on her self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there\nadvanced towards London, by the Great North Road, two persons,\nupon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some\nattention.\n\nThey were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better\ndescribed as a male and female:  for the former was one of those\nlong-limbed, knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is\ndifficult to assign any precise age,--looking as they do, when\nthey are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost\nmen, like overgrown boys.  The woman was young, but of a robust\nand hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the\nheavy bundle which was strapped to her back.  Her companion was\nnot encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a\nstick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped\nin a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.  This\ncircumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of\nunusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some\nhalf-dozen paces in advance of his companion, to whom he\noccasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head:  as if\nreproaching her tardiness, and urging her to greater exertion.\n\nThus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of\nany object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a\nwider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of\ntown, until they passed through Highgate archway; when the\nforemost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his\ncompanion,\n\n`Come on, can`t yer?  What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.`\n\n`It`s a heavy load, I can tell you,` said the female, coming up,\nalmost breathless with fatigue.\n\n`Heavy!  What are yer talking about?  What are yer made for?`\nrejoined the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he\nspoke, to the other shoulder.  `Oh, there yer are, resting again!\nWell, if yer ain`t enough to tire anybody`s patience out, I don`t\nknow what is!`\n\n`Is it much farther?` asked the woman, resting herself against a\nbank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her\nface.\n\n`Much farther!  Yer as good as there,` said the long-legged\ntramper, pointing out before him.  `Look there!  Those are the\nlights of London.`\n\n`They`re a good two mile off, at least,` said the woman\ndespondingly.\n\n`Never mind whether they`re two mile off, or twenty,` said Noah\nClaypole; for he it was; `but get up and come on, or I`ll kick\nyer, and so I give yer notice.`\n\nAs Noah`s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the\nroad while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into\nexecution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged\nonward by his side.\n\n`Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?` she asked, after\nthey had walked a few hundred yards.\n\n`How should I know?` replied Noah, whose temper had been\nconsiderably impaired by walking.\n\n`Near, I hope,` said Charlotte.\n\n`No, not near,` replied Mr. Claypole.  `There!  Not near; so\ndon`t think it.`\n\n`Why not?`\n\n`When I tell yer that I don`t mean to do a thing, that`s enough,\nwithout any why or because either,` replied Mr. Claypole with\ndignity.\n\n`Well, you needn`t be so cross,` said his companion.\n\n`A pretty thing it would be, wouldn`t it to go and stop at the\nvery first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if\nhe come up after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us\ntaken back in a cart with handcuffs on,` said Mr. Claypole in a\njeering tone.  `No!  I shall go and lose myself among the\nnarrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the\nvery out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on.  `Cod, yer may\nthanks yer stars I`ve got a head; for if we hadn`t gone, at\nfirst, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country,\nyer`d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady.  And\nserve yer right for being a fool.`\n\n`I know I ain`t as cunning as you are,` replied Charlotte; `but\ndon`t put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked\nup.  You would have been if I had been, any way.`\n\n`Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,` said Mr.\nClaypole.\n\n`I took it for you, Noah, dear,` rejoined Charlotte.\n\n`Did I keep it?` asked Mr. Claypole.\n\n`No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so\nyou are,` said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing\nher arm through his.\n\nThis was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole`s habit\nto repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be\nobserved, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted\nCharlotte to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued,\nthe money might be found on her:  which would leave him an\nopportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft, and would\ngreatly facilitate his chances of escape.  Of course, he entered\nat this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they\nwalked on very lovingly together.\n\nIn pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without\nhalting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he\nwisely judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of\nvehicles, that London began in earnest.  Just pausing to observe\nwhich appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently the\nmost to be avoided, he crossed into Saint John`s Road, and was\nsoon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways,\nwhich, lying between Gray`s Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that\npart of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has\nleft in the midst of London.\n\nThrough these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte\nafter him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance\nthe whole external character of some small public-house; now\njogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him to\nbelieve it too public for his purpose.  At length, he stopped in\nfront of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any\nhe had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from\nthe opposite pavement, graciously announced his intention of\nputting up there, for the night.\n\n`So give us the bundle,` said Noah, unstrapping it from the\nwoman`s shoulders, and slinging it over his own; `and don`t yer\nspeak, except when yer spoke to.  What`s the name of the\nhouse--t-h-r--three what?`\n\n`Cripples,` said Charlotte.\n\n`Three Cripples,` repeated Noah, `and a very good sign too.  Now,\nthen!  Keep close at my heels, and come along.`  With these\ninjunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and\nentered the house, followed by his companion.\n"}

{"text":"\nThere was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two\nelbows on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared\nvery hard at Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him.\n\nIf Noah had been attired in his charity-boy`s dress, there might\nhave been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but\nas he had discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short\nsmock-frock over his leathers, there seemed no particular reason\nfor his appearance exciting so much attention in a public-house.\n\n`Is this the Three Cripples?` asked Noah.\n\n`That is the dabe of this `ouse,` replied the Jew.\n\n`A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country,\nrecommended us here,` said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to\ncall her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting\nrespect, and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise.  `We want\nto sleep here to-night.`\n\n`I`b dot certaid you cad,` said Barney, who was the attendant\nsprite; `but I`ll idquire.`\n\n`Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of\nbeer while yer inquiring, will yer?` said Noah.\n\nBarney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and\nsetting the required viands before them; having done which, he\ninformed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and\nleft the amiable couple to their refreshment.\n\nNow, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some\nsteps lower, so that any person connected with the house,\nundrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass\nfixed in the wall of the last-named apartment, about five feet\nfrom its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in\nthe back-room without any great hazard of being observed (the\nglass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a\nlarge upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but\ncould, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with\ntolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation.  The\nlandlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place\nof espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned\nfrom making the communication above related, when Fagin, in the\ncourse of his evening`s business, came into the bar to inquire\nafter some of his young pupils.\n\n`Hush!` said Barney:  `stradegers id the next roob.`\n\n`Strangers!` repeated the old man in a whisper.\n\n`Ah!  Ad rub uds too,` added Barney.  `Frob the cuttry, but\nsubthig in your way, or I`b bistaked.`\n\nFagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.\n\nMounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of\nglass, from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking\ncold beef from the dish, and porter from the pot, and\nadministering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte, who sat\npatiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure.\n\n`Aha!` he whispered, looking round to Barney, `I like that\nfellow`s looks.  He`d be of use to us; he knows how to train the\ngirl already.  Don`t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and\nlet me hear `em talk--let me hear `em.`\n\nHe again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the\npartition, listened attentively:  with a subtle and eager look\nupon his face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.\n\n`So I mean to be a gentleman,` said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his\nlegs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which\nFagin had arrived too late to hear. `No more jolly old coffins,\nCharlotte, but a gentleman`s life for me:  and, if yer like, yer\nshall be a lady.`\n\n`I should like that well enough, dear,` replied Charlotte; `but\ntills ain`t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off\nafter it.`\n\n`Tills be blowed!` said Mr. Claypole; `there`s more things\nbesides tills to be emptied.`\n\n`What do you mean?` asked his companion.\n\n`Pockets, women`s ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!` said\nMr. Claypole, rising with the porter.\n\n`But you can`t do all that, dear,` said Charlotte.\n\n`I shall look out to get into company with them as can,` replied\nNoah.  `They`ll be able to make us useful some way or another.\nWhy, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a\nprecious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.`\n\n`Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!` exclaimed Charlotte,\nimprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.\n\n`There, that`ll do:  don`t yer be too affectionate, in case I`m\ncross with yer,` said Noah, disengaging himself with great\ngravity.  `I should like to be the captain of some band, and have\nthe whopping of `em, and follering `em about, unbeknown to\nthemselves.  That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if\nwe could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it\nwould be cheap at that twenty-pound note you`ve got,--especially\nas we don`t very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.`\n\nAfter expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the\nporter-pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken\nits contents, nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a\ndraught, wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed.  He was\nmeditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the\nappearance of a stranger, interrupted him.\n\nThe stranger was Mr. Fagin.  And very amiable he looked, and a\nvery low bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at\nthe nearest table, ordered something to drink of the grinning\nBarney.\n"}

{"text":"\n`A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,` said\nFagin, rubbing his hands.  `From the country, I see, sir?`\n\n`How do yer see that?` asked Noah Claypole.\n\n`We have not so much dust as that in London,` replied Fagin,\npointing from Noah`s shoes to those of his companion, and from\nthem to the two bundles.\n\n`Yer a sharp feller,` said Noah.  `Ha! ha! only hear that,\nCharlotte!`\n\n`Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,` replied the Jew,\nsinking his voice to a confidential whisper; `and that`s the\ntruth.`\n\nFagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose\nwith his right forefinger,--a gesture which Noah attempted to\nimitate, though not with complete success, in consequence of his\nown nose not being large enough for the purpose.  However, Mr.\nFagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect\ncoincidence with his opinion, and put about the liquor which\nBarney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner.\n\n`Good stuff that,` observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips.\n\n`Dear!` said Fagin.  `A man need be always emptying a till, or a\npocket, or a woman`s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a\nbank, if he drinks it regularly.`\n\nMr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks\nthan he fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to\nCharlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive\nterror.\n\n`Don`t mind me, my dear,` said Fagin, drawing his chair closer.\n`Ha! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance.\nIt was very lucky it was only me.`\n\n`I didn`t take it,` stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his\nlegs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well\nas he could under his chair; `it was all her doing; yer`ve got it\nnow, Charlotte, yer know yer have.`\n\n`No matter who`s got it, or who did it, my dear,` replied Fagin,\nglancing, nevertheless, with a hawk`s eye at the girl and the two\nbundles.  `I`m in that way myself, and I like you for it.`\n\n`In what way?` asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.\n\n`In that way of business,` rejoined Fagin; `and so are the people\nof the house.  You`ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are\nas safe here as you could be.  There is not a safer place in all\nthis town than is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it\nso.  And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman; so I`ve\nsaid the word, and you may make your minds easy.`\n\nNoah Claypole`s mind might have been at ease after this\nassurance, but his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and\nwrithed about, into various uncouth positions:  eyeing his new\nfriend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion.\n\n`I`ll tell you more,` said Fagin, after he had reassured the\ngirl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. `I\nhave got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and\nput you in the right way, where you can take whatever department\nof the business you think will suit you best at first, and be\ntaught all the others.`\n\n`Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,` replied Noah.\n\n`What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?` inquired\nFagin, shrugging his shoulders.  `Here!  Let me have a word with\nyou outside.`\n\n`There`s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,` said Noah,\ngetting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. `She`ll take\nthe luggage upstairs the while.  Charlotte, see to them bundles.`\n\nThis mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was\nobeyed without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best\nof her way off with the packages while Noah held the door open\nand watched her out.\n\n`She`s kept tolerably well under, ain`t she?` he asked as he\nresumed his seat:  in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some\nwild animal.\n\n`Quite perfect,` rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder.\n`You`re a genius, my dear.`\n\n`Why, I suppose if I wasn`t, I shouldn`t be here,` replied Noah.\n`But, I say, she`ll be back if yer lose time.`\n\n`Now, what do you think?` said Fagin.  `If you was to like my\nfriend, could you do better than join him?`\n\n`Is he in a good way of business; that`s where it is!` responded\nNoah, winking one of his little eyes.\n\n`The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best\nsociety in the profession.`\n\n`Regular town-maders?` asked Mr. Claypole.\n"}

Payment stopped at the Bank?\nAh!  It`s not worth much to him.  It`ll have to go abroad, and he\ncouldn`t sell it for a great deal in the market.`\n\n`When could I see him?` asked Noah doubtfully.\n\n`To-morrow morning.`\n\n`Where?`\n\n`Here.`\n\n`Um!` said Noah.  `What`s the wages?`\n\n`Live like a gentleman--board and lodging, pipes and spirits\nfree--half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman\nearns,` replied Mr. Fagin.\n\nWhether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least\ncomprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms,\nhad he been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he\nrecollected that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the\npower of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice\nimmediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he\ngradually relented, and said he thought that would suit him.\n\n`But, yer see,` observed Noah, `as she will be able to do a good\ndeal, I should like to take something very light.`\n\n`A little fancy work?` suggested Fagin.\n\n`Ah! something of that sort,` replied Noah.  `What do you think\nwould suit me now?  Something not too trying for the strength,\nand not very dangerous, you know.  That`s the sort of thing!`\n\n`I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my\ndear,` said Fagin.  `My friend wants somebody who would do that\nwell, very much.`\n\n`Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn`t mind turning my hand to\nit sometimes,` rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; `but it wouldn`t pay\nby itself, you know.`\n\n`That`s true!` observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to\nruminate.  `No, it might not.`\n\n`What do you think, then?` asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.\n`Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work,\nand not much more risk than being at home.`\n\n`What do you think of the old ladies?` asked Fagin. `There`s a\ngood deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and\nrunning round the corner.`\n\n`Don`t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?` asked\nNoah, shaking his head.  `I don`t think that would answer my\npurpose.  Ain`t there any other line open?`\n\n`Stop!` said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah`s knee.  `The kinchin\nlay.`\n\n`What`s that?` demanded Mr. Claypole.\n\n`The kinchins, my dear,` said Fagin, `is the young children\nthat`s sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and\nshillings; and the lay is just to take their money away--they`ve\nalways got it ready in their hands,--then knock `em into the\nkennel, and walk off very slow, as if there were nothing else the\nmatter but a child fallen down and hurt itself.  Ha! ha! ha!`\n\n`Ha! ha!` roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy.\n`Lord, that`s the very thing!`\n\n`To be sure it is,` replied Fagin; `and you can have a few good\nbeats chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and\nneighborhoods like that, where they`re always going errands; and\nyou can upset as many kinchins as you want, any hour in the day.\nHa! ha! ha!`\n\nWith this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined\nin a burst of laughter both long and loud.\n\n`Well, that`s all right!` said Noah, when he had recovered\nhimself, and Charlotte had returned.  `What time to-morrow shall\nwe say?`\n\n`Will ten do?` asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded\nassent, `What name shall I tell my good friend.`\n"}

Pooh! pooh!  There ain`t such\na thing in nature.`\n\n`There oughn`t to be, if there is,` replied Mr. Bolter.\n\n`That stands to reason.  Some conjurers say that number three is\nthe magic number, and some say number seven.  It`s neither, my\nfriend, neither.  It`s number one.\n\n`Ha! ha!` cried Mr. Bolter.  `Number one for ever.`\n\n`In a little community like ours, my dear,` said Fagin, who felt\nit necessary to qualify this position, `we have a general number\none, without considering me too as the same, and all the other\nyoung people.`\n\n`Oh, the devil!` exclaimed Mr. Bolter.\n\n`You see,` pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this\ninterruption, `we are so mixed up together, and identified in our\ninterests, that it must be so.  For instance, it`s your object to\ntake care of number one--meaning yourself.`\n\n`Certainly,` replied Mr. Bolter.  `Yer about right there.`\n\n`Well!  You can`t take care of yourself, number one, without\ntaking care of me, number one.`\n\n`Number two, you mean,` said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed\nwith the quality of selfishness.\n\n`No, I don`t!` retorted Fagin.  `I`m of the same importance to\nyou, as you are to yourself.`\n\n`I say,` interrupted Mr. Bolter, `yer a very nice man, and I`m\nvery fond of yer; but we ain`t quite so thick together, as all\nthat comes to.`\n\n`Only think,` said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching\nout his hands; `only consider.  You`ve done what`s a very pretty\nthing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time\nwould put the cravat round your throat, that`s so very easily\ntied and so very difficult to unloose--in plain English, the\nhalter!`\n\nMr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it\ninconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone\nbut not in substance.\n\n`The gallows,` continued Fagin, `the gallows, my dear, is an ugly\nfinger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that\nhas stopped many a bold fellow`s career on the broad highway.  To\nkeep in the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object\nnumber one with you.`\n\n`Of course it is,` replied Mr. Bolter.  `What do yer talk about\nsuch things for?`\n\n`Only to show you my meaning clearly,` said the Jew, raising his\neyebrows.  `To be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my\nlittle business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your\nnumber one, the second my number one.  The more you value your\nnumber one, the more careful you must be of mine; so we come at\nlast to what I told you at first--that a regard for number one\nholds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to\npieces in company.`\n\n`That`s true,` rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully.  `Oh! yer a\ncunning old codger!`\n\nMr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was\nno mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit\nwith a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that\nhe should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance.  To\nstrengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up\nthe blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude\nand extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction\ntogether, as best served his purpose; and bringing both to bear,\nwith so much art, that Mr. Bolter`s respect visibly increased,\nand became tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome\nfear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.\n\n`It`s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me\nunder heavy losses,` said Fagin.  `My best hand was taken from\nme, yesterday morning.`\n\n`You don`t mean to say he died?` cried Mr. Bolter.\n\n`No, no,` replied Fagin, `not so bad as that.  Not quite so bad.`\n\n`What, I suppose he was--`\n\n`Wanted,` interposed Fagin.  `Yes, he was wanted.`\n\n`Very particular?` inquired Mr. Bolter.\n\n`No,` replied Fagin, `not very.  He was charged with attempting\nto pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,--his\nown, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very\nfond of it.  They remanded him till to-day, for they thought they\nknew the owner.  Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I`d give the\nprice of as many to have him back.  You should have known the\nDodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.`\n\n`Well, but I shall know him, I hope; don`t yer think so?` said\nMr. Bolter.\n\n`I`m doubtful about it,` replied Fagin, with a sigh.  `If they\ndon`t get any fresh evidence, it`ll only be a summary conviction,\nand we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if\nthey do, it`s a case of lagging.  They know what a clever lad he\nis; he`ll be a lifer.  They`ll make the Artful nothing less than\na lifer.`\n\n`What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?` demanded Mr. Bolter.\n`What`s the good of talking in that way to me; why don`t yer\nspeak so as I can understand yer?`\n\nFagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into\nthe vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have\nbeen informed that they represented that combination of words,\n`transportation for life,` when the dialogue was cut short by the\nentry of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets,\nand his face twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.\n\n`It`s all up, Fagin,` said Charley, when he and his new companion\nhad been made known to each other.\n\n`What do you mean?`\n\n`They`ve found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more`s\na coming to `dentify him; and the Artful`s booked for a passage\nout,` replied Master Bates.  `I must have a full suit of\nmourning, Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets\nout upon his travels.  To think of Jack Dawkins--lummy Jack--the\nDodger--the Artful Dodger--going abroad for a common\ntwopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box!  I never thought he`d a done it\nunder a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest.  Oh, why\ndidn`t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go\nout as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour\nnor glory!`\n\nWith this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend,\nMaster Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of\nchagrin and despondency.\n\n`What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!`\nexclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. `Wasn`t he\nalways the top-sawyer among you all!  Is there one of you that\ncould touch him or come near him on any scent!  Eh?`\n\n`Not one,` replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by\nregret; `not one.`\n"}

All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack\nDawkins addressing of `em as intimate and comfortable as if he\nwas the judge`s own son making a speech arter dinner--ha! ha!\nha!`\n\nIn fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend`s\neccentric disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been\ndisposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of\na victim, now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of\nmost uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for\nthe arrival of the time when his old companion should have so\nfavourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities.\n\n`We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or\nother,` said Fagin.  `Let me think.`\n\n`Shall I go?` asked Charley.\n\n`Not for the world,` replied Fagin.  `Are you mad, my dear, stark\nmad, that you`d walk into the very place where--No, Charley, no.\nOne is enough to lose at a time.`\n\n`You don`t mean to go yourself, I suppose?` said Charley with a\nhumorous leer.\n\n`That wouldn`t quite fit,` replied Fagin shaking his head.\n\n`Then why don`t you send this new cove?` asked Master Bates,\nlaying his hand on Noah`s arm.  `Nobody knows him.`\n\n`Why, if he didn`t mind--` observed Fagin.\n\n`Mind!` interposed Charley.  `What should he have to mind?`\n\n`Really nothing, my dear,` said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter,\n`really nothing.`\n\n`Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,` observed Noah, backing\ntowards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober\nalarm.  `No, no--none of that.  It`s not in my department, that\nain`t.`\n\n`Wot department has he got, Fagin?` inquired Master Bates,\nsurveying Noah`s lank form with much disgust.  `The cutting away\nwhen there`s anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when\nthere`s everything right; is that his branch?`\n\n`Never mind,` retorted Mr. Bolter; `and don`t yer take liberties\nwith yer superiors, little boy, or yer`ll find yerself in the\nwrong shop.`\n\nMaster Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat,\nthat it was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent\nto Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the\npolice-office; that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair\nin which he had engaged, nor any description of his person, had\nyet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that\nhe was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter;\nand that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as safe a\nspot for him to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be,\nof all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed\nlikely to resort of his own free will.\n\nPersuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a\nmuch greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length\nconsented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition.\nBy Fagin`s directions, he immediately substituted for his own\nattire, a waggoner`s frock, velveteen breeches, and leather\nleggings:  all of which articles the Jew had at hand.  He was\nlikewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike\ntickets; and a carter`s whip.  Thus equipped, he was to saunter\ninto the office, as some country fellow from Covent Garden market\nmight be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity;\nand as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow as\nneed be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to\nperfection.\n\nThese arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary\nsigns and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was\nconveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within\na very short distance of Bow Street. Having described the precise\nsituation of the office, and accompanied it with copious\ndirections how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when\nhe got into the side, and pull off his hat as he went into the\nroom, Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide\nhis return on the spot of their parting.\n"}

{"text":"\nNoah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually\nfollowed the directions he had received, which--Master Bates\nbeing pretty well acquainted with the locality--were so exact\nthat he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without\nasking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way.\n\nHe found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women,\nwho were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper\nend of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with\na dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box\nfor the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates\non the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off\nby a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze,\nand left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty\nof justice.\n\nThere were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding\nto their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions\nto a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant\nover the table.  A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail,\ntapping his nose listlessly with a large key, except when he\nrepressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by\nproclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman `Take\nthat baby out,` when the gravity of justice was disturbed by\nfeeble cries, half-smothered in the mother`s shawl, from some\nmeagre infant.  The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls\nwere dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened.  There was an\nold smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the\ndock--the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought;\nfor depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both,\nhad left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less\nunpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inamimate object\nthat frowned upon it.\n\nNoah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there\nwere several women who would have done very well for that\ndistinguished character`s mother or sister, and more than one man\nwho might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father,\nnobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins\nwas to be seen.  He waited in a state of much suspense and\nuncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went\nflaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of\nanother prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the\nobject of his visit.\n\nIt was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with\nthe big coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his\npocket, and his hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with\na rolling gait altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in\nthe dock, requested in an audible voice to know what he was\nplaced in that `ere disgraceful sitivation for.\n\n`Hold your tongue, will you?` said the jailer.\n\n`I`m an Englishman, ain`t I?` rejoined the Dodger.  `Where are my\npriwileges?`\n\n`You`ll get your privileges soon enough,` retorted the jailer,\n`and pepper with `em.`\n\n`We`ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has\ngot to say to the beaks, if I don`t,` replied Mr. Dawkins.  `Now\nthen!  Wot is this here business?  I shall thank the madg`strates\nto dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while\nthey read the paper, for I`ve got an appointment with a genelman\nin the City, and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in\nbusiness matters, he`ll go away if I ain`t there to my time, and\nthen pr`aps ther won`t be an action for damage against them as\nkep me away.  Oh no, certainly not!`\n\nAt this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular\nwith a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the\njailer to communicate `the names of them two files as was on the\nbench.`  Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed\nalmost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had\nheard the request.\n\n`Silence there!` cried the jailer.\n\n`What is this?` inquired one of the magistrates.\n\n`A pick-pocketing case, your worship.`\n\n`Has the boy ever been here before?`\n\n`He ought to have been, a many times,` replied the jailer. `He\nhas been pretty well everywhere else.  _I_ know him well, your\nworship.`\n\n`Oh! you know me, do you?` cried the Artful, making a note of the\nstatement.  `Wery good.  That`s a case of deformation of\ncharacter, any way.`\n\nHere there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.\n\n`Now then, where are the witnesses?` said the clerk.\n\n`Ah! that`s right,` added the Dodger.  `Where are they?  I should\nlike to see `em.`\n\nThis wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped\nforward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an\nunknown gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief\ntherefrom, which, being a very old one, he deliberately put back\nagain, after trying it on his own countenance.  For this reason,\nhe took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him,\nand the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver\nsnuff-box, with the owner`s name engraved upon the lid.  This\ngentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide,\nand being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was\nhis, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he\nhad disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.  He had\nalso remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly\nactive in making his way about, and that young gentleman was the\nprisoner before him.\n\n`Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?` said the\nmagistrate.\n\n`I wouldn`t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation\nwith him,` replied the Dodger.\n\n`Have you anything to say at all?`\n\n`Do you hear his worship ask if you`ve anything to say?` inquired\nthe jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.\n\n`I beg your pardon,` said the Dodger, looking up with an air of\nabstraction.  `Did you redress yourself to me, my man?`\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nTHE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE.\nSHE FAILS.\n\nAdept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation,\nthe girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the\nknowledge of the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind.  She\nremembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had\nconfided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all others:\nin the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the\nreach of their suspicion.  Vile as those schemes were, desperate\nas were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings\ntowards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper\ndown into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;\nstill, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some\nrelenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron\ngrasp he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last--richly\nas he merited such a fate--by her hand.\n\nBut, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach\nitself from old companions and associations, though enabled to\nfix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned\naside by any consideration.  Her fears for Sikes would have been\nmore powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but\nshe had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she\nhad dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had\nrefused, even for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and\nwretchedness that encompasses her--and what more could she do!\nShe was resolved.\n\nThough all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion,\nthey forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their\ntraces too.  She grew pale and thin, even within a few days.  At\ntimes, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no\npart in conversations where once, she would have been the\nloudest.  At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was\nnoisy without a moment afterwards--she sat silent and dejected,\nbrooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by\nwhich she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these\nindications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were\noccupied with matters very different and distant from those in\nthe course of discussion by her companions.\n\nIt was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck\nthe hour.  Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to\nlisten.  The girl looked up from the low seat on which she\ncrouched, and listened too.  Eleven.\n\n`An hour this side of midnight,` said Sikes, raising the blind to\nlook out and returning to his seat.  `Dark and heavy it is too.\nA good night for business this.`\n\n`Ah!` replied Fagin.  `What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there`s\nnone quite ready to be done.`\n\n`You`re right for once,` replied Sikes gruffly.  `It is a pity,\nfor I`m in the humour too.`\n\nFagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.\n\n`We must make up for lost time when we`ve got things into a good\ntrain.  That`s all I know,` said Sikes.\n\n`That`s the way to talk, my dear,` replied Fagin, venturing to\npat him on the shoulder.  `It does me good to hear you.`\n\n`Does you good, does it!` cried Sikes.  `Well, so be it.`\n\n`Ha! ha! ha!` laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this\nconcession.  `You`re like yourself to-night, Bill.  Quite like\nyourself.`\n\n`I don`t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on\nmy shoulder, so take it away,` said Sikes, casting off the Jew`s\nhand.\n\n`It make you nervous, Bill,--reminds you of being nabbed, does\nit?` said Fagin, determined not to be offended.\n\n`Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,` returned Sikes. `There\nnever was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was\nyour father, and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard\nby this time, unless you came straight from the old `un without\nany father at all betwixt you; which I shouldn`t wonder at, a\nbit.`\n"}

{"text":"\nFagin offered no reply to this compliment:  but, pulling Sikes by\nthe sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken\nadvantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and\nwas now leaving the room.\n\n`Hallo!` cried Sikes.  `Nance.  Where`s the gal going to at this\ntime of night?`\n\n`Not far.`\n\n`What answer`s that?` retorted Sikes.  `Do you hear me?`\n\n`I don`t know where,` replied the girl.\n\n`Then I do,` said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than\nbecause he had any real objection to the girl going where she\nlisted.  `Nowhere.  Sit down.`\n\n`I`m not well.  I told you that before,` rejoined the girl.  `I\nwant a breath of air.`\n\n`Put your head out of the winder,` replied Sikes.\n\n`There`s not enough there,` said the girl.  `I want it in the\nstreet.`\n\n`Then you won`t have it,` replied Sikes.  With which assurance he\nrose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet\nfrom her head, flung it up to the top of an old press.  `There,`\nsaid the robber.  `Now stop quietly where you are, will you?`\n\n`It`s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,` said the girl\nturning very pale.  `What do you mean, Bill?  Do you know what\nyou`re doing?`\n\n`Know what I`m--Oh!` cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, `she`s out of\nher senses, you know, or she daren`t talk to me in that way.`\n\n`You`ll drive me on the something desperate,` muttered the girl\nplacing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by\nforce some violent outbreak.  `Let me go, will you,--this\nminute--this instant.`\n\n`No!` said Sikes.\n\n`Tell him to let me go, Fagin.  He had better.  It`ll be better\nfor him.  Do you hear me?` cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the\nground.\n\n`Hear you!` repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront\nher.  `Aye!  And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog\nshall have such a grip on your throat as`ll tear some of that\nscreaming voice out.  Wot has come over you, you jade!  Wot is\nit?`\n\n`Let me go,` said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting\nherself down on the floor, before the door, she said, `Bill, let\nme go; you don`t know what you are doing. You don`t, indeed.  For\nonly one hour--do--do!`\n\n`Cut my limbs off one by one!` cried Sikes, seizing her roughly\nby the arm, `If I don`t think the gal`s stark raving mad.  Get\nup.`\n\n`Not till you let me go--not till you let me go--Never--never!`\nscreamed the girl.  Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his\nopportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her,\nstruggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room\nadjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her\ninto a chair, held her down by force.  She struggled and implored\nby turns until twelve o`clock had struck, and then, wearied and\nexhausted, ceased to contest the point any further.  With a\ncaution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out\nthat night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined\nFagin.\n\n`Whew!` said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his\nface.  `Wot a precious strange gal that is!`\n\n`You may say that, Bill,` replied Fagin thoughtfully.  `You may\nsay that.`\n\n`Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you\nthink?` asked Sikes.  `Come; you should know her better than me.\nWot does it mean?`\n\n`Obstinacy; woman`s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.`\n\n`Well, I suppose it is,` growled Sikes.  `I thought I had tamed\nher, but she`s as bad as ever.`\n\n`Worse,` said Fagin thoughtfully.  `I never knew her like this,\nfor such a little cause.`\n\n`Nor I,` said Sikes.  `I think she`s got a touch of that fever in\nher blood yet, and it won`t come out--eh?`\n"}

{"text":"\n`Like enough.`\n\n`I`ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if\nshe`s took that way again,` said Sikes.\n\nFagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.\n\n`She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was\nstretched on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you\nare, kept yourself aloof,` said Sikes.  `We was poor too, all the\ntime, and I think, one way or other, it`s worried and fretted\nher; and that being shut up here so long has made her\nrestless--eh?`\n\n`That`s it, my dear,` replied the Jew in a whisper.  `Hush!`\n\nAs he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed\nher former seat.  Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked\nherself to and fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time,\nburst out laughing.\n\n`Why, now she`s on the other tack!` exclaimed Sikes, turning a\nlook of excessive surprise on his companion.\n\nFagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in\na few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour.\nWhispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin\ntook up his hat and bade him good-night.  He paused when he\nreached the room-door, and looking round, asked if somebody would\nlight him down the dark stairs.\n\n`Light him down,` said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. `It`s a\npity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the\nsight-seers.  Show him a light.`\n\nNancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle.  When they\nreached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing\nclose to the girl, said, in a whisper.\n\n`What is it, Nancy, dear?`\n\n`What do you mean?` replied the girl, in the same tone.\n\n`The reason of all this,` replied Fagin.  `If _he_`--he pointed\nwith his skinny fore-finger up the stairs--`is so hard with you\n(he`s a brute, Nance, a brute-beast), why don`t you--`\n\n`Well?` said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost\ntouching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.\n\n`No matter just now.  We`ll talk of this again.  You have a\nfriend in me, Nance; a staunch friend.  I have the means at hand,\nquiet and close.  If you want revenge on those that treat you\nlike a dog--like a dog!  worse than his dog, for he humours him\nsometimes--come to me.  I say, come to me.  He is the mere hound\nof a day, but you know me of old, Nance.`\n\n`I know you well,` replied the girl, without manifesting the\nleast emotion.  `Good-night.`\n\nShe shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but\nsaid good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his\nparting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between\nthem.\n\nFagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were\nworking within his brain.  He had conceived the idea--not from\nwhat had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but\nslowly and by degrees--that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker`s\nbrutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend.  Her\naltered manner, her repeated absences from home alone, her\ncomparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which\nshe had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate\nimpatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all\nfavoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him at least,\nalmost matter of certainty.  The object of this new liking was\nnot among his myrmidons.  He would be a valuable acquisition with\nsuch an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be\nsecured without delay.\n\nThere was another, and a darker object, to be gained.  Sikes knew\ntoo much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less,\nbecause the wounds were hidden.  The girl must know, well, that\nif she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and\nthat it would be surely wreaked--to the maiming of limbs, or\nperhaps the loss of life--on the object of her more recent fancy.\n\n`With a little persuasion,` thought Fagin, `what more likely than\nthat she would consent to poison him?  Women have done such\nthings, and worse, to secure the same object before now.  There\nwould be the dangerous villain:  the man I hate:  gone; another\nsecured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a\nknowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.`\n\nThese things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short\ntime he sat alone, in the housebreaker`s room; and with them\nuppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity\nafterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints\nhe threw out at parting.  There was no expression of surprise, no\nassumption of an inability to understand his meaning.  The girl\nclearly comprehended it.  Her glance at parting showed _that_.\n\nBut perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of\nSikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained. `How,`\nthought Fagin, as he crept homeward, `can I increase my influence\nwith her?  What new power can I acquire?`\n\nSuch brains are fertile in expedients.  If, without extracting a\nconfession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object\nof her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history\nto Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered\ninto his designs, could he not secure her compliance?\n\n`I can,` said Fagin, almost aloud.  `She durst not refuse me\nthen.  Not for her life, not for her life!  I have it all.  The\nmeans are ready, and shall be set to work.  I shall have you\nyet!`\n\nHe cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand,\ntowards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went\non his way:  busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered\ngarment, which he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there\nwere a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers.\n\n"}

The\nkinchin lay will be a fortune to you.`\n\n`Don`t you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,` said\nMr. Bolter.\n\n`No, no, my dear.  The pint-pots were great strokes of genius:\nbut the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.`\n\n`Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,` remarked Mr. Bolter\ncomplacently.  `The pots I took off airy railings, and the\nmilk-can was standing by itself outside a public-house.  I\nthought it might get rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer\nknow.  Eh?  Ha! ha! ha!`\n\nFagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had\nhis laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his\nfirst hunk of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.\n\n`I want you, Bolter,` said Fagin, leaning over the table, `to do\na piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and\ncaution.`\n\n`I say,` rejoined Bolter, `don`t yer go shoving me into danger,\nor sending me any more o` yer police-offices. That don`t suit me,\nthat don`t; and so I tell yer.`\n\n`That`s not the smallest danger in it--not the very smallest,`\nsaid the Jew; `it`s only to dodge a woman.`\n\n`An old woman?` demanded Mr. Bolter.\n\n`A young one,` replied Fagin.\n\n`I can do that pretty well, I know,` said Bolter.  `I was a\nregular cunning sneak when I was at school.  What am I to dodge\nher for?  Not to--`\n\n`Not to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees,\nand, if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is\na street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back\nall the information you can.`\n\n`What`ll yer give me?` asked Noah, setting down his cup, and\nlooking his employer, eagerly, in the face.\n\n`If you do it well, a pound, my dear.  One pound,` said Fagin,\nwishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible.  `And\nthat`s what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there\nwasn`t valuable consideration to be gained.`\n\n`Who is she?` inquired Noah.\n\n`One of us.`\n\n`Oh Lor!` cried Noah, curling up his nose.  `Yer doubtful of her,\nare yer?`\n\n`She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who\nthey are,` replied Fagin.\n\n`I see,` said Noah.  `Just to have the pleasure of knowing them,\nif they`re respectable people, eh?  Ha! ha! ha! I`m your man.`\n\n`I knew you would be,` cried Fagin, elated by the success of his\nproposal.\n\n`Of course, of course,` replied Noah.  `Where is she? Where am I\nto wait for her?  Where am I to go?`\n\n`All that, my dear, you shall hear from me.  I`ll point her out\nat the proper time,` said Fagin.  `You keep ready, and leave the\nrest to me.`\n\nThat night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted\nand equipped in his carter`s dress:  ready to turn out at a word\nfrom Fagin.  Six nights passed--six long weary nights--and on\neach, Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly\nintimated that it was not yet time.  On the seventh, he returned\nearlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal.  It was\nSunday.\n"}

{"text":"\n`She goes abroad to-night,` said Fagin, `and on the right errand,\nI`m sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is\nafraid of will not be back much before daybreak.  Come with me.\nQuick!`\n\nNoah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state\nof such intense excitement that it infected him.  They left the\nhouse stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets,\narrived at length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as\nthe same in which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in\nLondon.\n\nIt was past eleven o`clock, and the door was closed.  It opened\nsoftly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered,\nwithout noise; and the door was closed behind them.\n\nScarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for\nwords, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed\nout the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and\nobserve the person in the adjoining room.\n\n`Is that the woman?` he asked, scarcely above his breath.\n\nFagin nodded yes.\n\n`I can`t see her face well,` whispered Noah.  `She is looking\ndown, and the candle is behind her.\n\n`Stay there,` whispered Fagin.  He signed to Barney, who\nwithdrew.  In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining,\nand, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the\nrequired position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise\nher face.\n\n`I see her now,` cried the spy.\n\n`Plainly?`\n\n`I should know her among a thousand.`\n\nHe hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came\nout.  Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained\noff, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet\nof their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which\nthey had entered.\n\n`Hist!` cried the lad who held the door.  `Dow.`\n\nNoah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.\n\n`To the left,` whispered the lad; `take the left had, and keep od\nthe other side.`\n\nHe did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl`s\nretreating figure, already at some distance before him.  He\nadvanced as near as he considered prudent, and kept on the\nopposite side of the street, the better to observe her motions.\nShe looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to\nlet two men who were following close behind her, pass on.  She\nseemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a\nsteadier and firmer step.  The spy preserved the same relative\ndistance between them, and followed:  with his eye upon her.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nTHE APPOINTMENT KEPT\n\nThe church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two\nfigures emerged on London Bridge.  One, which advanced with a\nswift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly\nabout her as though in quest of some expected object; the other\nfigure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow\nhe could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to\nhers:  stopping when she stopped:  and as she moved again,\ncreeping stealthily on:  but never allowing himself, in the\nardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps.  Thus, they\ncrossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when\nthe woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the\nfoot-passengers, turned back.  The movement was sudden; but he\nwho watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for,\nshrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of\nthe bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal\nhis figure, he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement.\nWhen she was about the same distance in advance as she had been\nbefore, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again. At\nnearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped.  The man stopped\ntoo.\n\nIt was a very dark night.  The day had been unfavourable, and at\nthat hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there\nwere, hurried quickly past:  very possibly without seeing, but\ncertainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept\nher in view.  Their appearance was not calculated to attract the\nimportunate regards of such of London`s destitute population, as\nchanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of\nsome cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they\nstood there in silence:  neither speaking nor spoken to, by any\none who passed.\n\nA mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires\nthat burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs,\nand rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on\nthe banks.  The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side,\nrose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and\nfrowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their\nlumbering shapes. The tower of old Saint Saviour`s Church, and\nthe spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the\nancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of\nshipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of\nchurches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.\n\nThe girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro--closely\nwatched meanwhile by her hidden observer--when the heavy bell of\nSt. Paul`s tolled for the death of another day.  Midnight had\ncome upon the crowded city.  The palace, the night-cellar, the\njail, the madhouse:  the chambers of birth and death, of health\nand sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of\nthe child:  midnight was upon them all.\n\nThe hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady,\naccompanied by a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a\nhackney-carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and,\nhaving dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it.  They\nhad scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started,\nand immediately made towards them.\n\nThey walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons\nwho entertained some very slight expectation which had little\nchance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this\nnew associate.  They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but\nsuppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a\ncountryman came close up--brushed against them, indeed--at that\nprecise moment.\n\n`Not here,` said Nancy hurriedly, `I am afraid to speak to you\nhere.  Come away--out of the public road--down the steps yonder!`\n\nAs she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the\ndirection in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman\nlooked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole\npavement for, passed on.\n\nThe steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the\nSurrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint\nSaviour`s Church, form a landing-stairs from the river.  To this\nspot, the man bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened\nunobserved; and after a moment`s survey of the place, he began to\ndescend.\n\nThese stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three\nflights.  Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone\nwall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing\ntowards the Thames.  At this point the lower steps widen:  so\nthat a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily\nunseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if\nonly a step. The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached\nthis point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment,\nand, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped\naside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited:  pretty\ncertain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could\nnot hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.\n\nSo tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was\nthe spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different\nfrom what he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave\nthe matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they\nhad stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different\nspot to hold their mysterious conversation.  He was on the point\nof emerging from his hiding-place, and regaining the road above,\nwhen he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of\nvoices almost close at his ear.\n\nHe drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely\nbreathing, listened attentively.\n\n`This is far enough,` said a voice, which was evidently that of\nthe gentleman.  `I will not suffer the young lady to go any\nfarther.  Many people would have distrusted you too much to have\ncome even so far, but you see I am willing to humour you.`\n\n`To humour me!` cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed.\n`You`re considerate, indeed, sir.  To humour me!  Well, well,\nit`s no matter.`\n\n`Why, for what,` said the gentleman in a kinder tone, `for what\npurpose can you have brought us to this strange place?  Why not\nhave let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and\nthere is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark\nand dismal hole?`\n\n`I told you before,` replied Nancy, `that I was afraid to speak\nto you there.  I don`t know why it is,` said the girl,\nshuddering, `but I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night\nthat I can hardly stand.`\n\n`A fear of what?` asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.\n\n`I scarcely know of what,` replied the girl.  `I wish I did.\nHorrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and\na fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon\nme all day.  I was reading a book to-night, to wile the time\naway, and the same things came into the print.`\n\n`Imagination,` said the gentleman, soothing her.\n\n`No imagination,` replied the girl in a hoarse voice. `I`ll swear\nI saw \"coffin\" written in every page of the book in large black\nletters,--aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets\nto-night.`\n\n`There is nothing unusual in that,` said the gentleman. `They\nhave passed me often.`\n\n`_Real ones_,` rejoined the girl.  `This was not.`\n\nThere was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of\nthe concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these\nwords, and the blood chilled within him.  He had never\nexperienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of\nthe young lady as she begged her to be calm, and not allow\nherself to become the prey of such fearful fancies.\n\n`Speak to her kindly,` said the young lady to her companion.\n`Poor creature!  She seems to need it.`\n\n`Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to\nsee me as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,`\ncried the girl.  `Oh, dear lady, why ar`n`t those who claim to be\nGod`s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you,\nwho, having youth, and beauty, and all that they have lost, might\nbe a little proud instead of so much humbler?`\n\n`Ah!` said the gentleman.  `A Turk turns his face, after washing\nit well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good\npeople, after giving their faces such a rub against the World as\nto take the smiles off, turn with no less regularity, to the\ndarkest side of Heaven.  Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee,\ncommend me to the first!`\n\nThese words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were\nperhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover\nherself.  The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to\nher.\n"}

{"text":"\n`You were not here last Sunday night,` he said.\n\n`I couldn`t come,` replied Nancy; `I was kept by force.`\n\n`By whom?`\n\n`Him that I told the young lady of before.`\n\n`You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody\non the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?` asked\nthe old gentleman.\n\n`No,` replied the girl, shaking her head.  `It`s not very easy\nfor me to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn`t give him a\ndrink of laudanum before I came away.`\n\n`Did he awake before you returned?` inquired the gentleman.\n\n`No; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.`\n\n`Good,` said the gentleman.  `Now listen to me.`\n\n`I am ready,` replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.\n\n`This young lady,` the gentleman began, `has communicated to me,\nand to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you\ntold her nearly a fortnight since.  I confess to you that I had\ndoubts, at first, whether you were to be implicitly relied upon,\nbut now I firmly believe you are.`\n\n`I am,` said the girl earnestly.\n\n`I repeat that I firmly believe it.  To prove to you that I am\ndisposed to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we\npropose to extort the secret, whatever it may be, from the fear\nof this man Monks.  But if--if--` said the gentleman, `he cannot\nbe secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you\nmust deliver up the Jew.`\n\n`Fagin,` cried the girl, recoiling.\n\n`That man must be delivered up by you,` said the gentleman.\n\n`I will not do it!  I will never do it!` replied the girl. `Devil\nthat he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will\nnever do that.`\n\n`You will not?` said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for\nthis answer.\n\n`Never!` returned the girl.\n\n`Tell me why?`\n\n`For one reason,` rejoined the girl firmly, `for one reason, that\nthe lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I\nhave her promise:  and for this other reason, besides, that, bad\nlife as he has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of\nus who have kept the same courses together, and I`ll not turn\nupon them, who might--any of them--have turned upon me, but\ndidn`t, bad as they are.`\n\n`Then,` said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the\npoint he had been aiming to attain; `put Monks into my hands, and\nleave him to me to deal with.`\n\n`What if he turns against the others?`\n\n`I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from\nhim, there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in\nOliver`s little history which it would be painful to drag before\nthe public eye, and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go\nscot free.`\n\n`And if it is not?` suggested the girl.\n\n`Then,` pursued the gentleman, `this Fagin shall not be brought\nto justice without your consent.  In such a case I could show you\nreasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.`\n\n`Have I the lady`s promise for that?` asked the girl.\n\n`You have,` replied Rose.  `My true and faithful pledge.`\n\n`Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?` said the\ngirl, after a short pause.\n\n`Never,` replied the gentleman.  `The intelligence should be\nbrought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.`\n\n`I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,` said\nthe girl after another interval of silence, `but I will take your\nwords.`\n\nAfter receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do\nso, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult\nfor the listener to discover even the purport of what she said,\nto describe, by name and situation, the public-house whence she\nhad been followed that night.  From the manner in which she\noccasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making\nsome hasty notes of the information she communicated.  When she\nhad thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best\nposition from which to watch it without exciting observation, and\nthe night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of\nfrequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the\npurpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly\nto her recollection.\n\n`He is tall,` said the girl, `and a strongly made man, but not\nstout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks\nover his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other.\nDon`t forget that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much\ndeeper than any other man`s, that you might almost tell him by\nthat alone.  His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and,\nalthough he can`t be more than six or eight and twenty, withered\nand haggard. His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with\nthe marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even\nbites his hands and covers them with wounds--why did you start?`\nsaid the girl, stopping suddenly.\n\nThe gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not\nconscious of having done so, and begged her to proceed.\n\n`Part of this,` said the girl, `I have drawn out from other\npeople at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him\ntwice, and both times he was covered up in a large cloak.  I\nthink that`s all I can give you to know him by.  Stay though,`\nshe added.  `Upon his throat:  so high that you can see a part of\nit below his neckerchief when he turns his face:  there is--`\n\n`A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?` cried the gentleman.\n\n`How`s this?` said the girl.  `You know him!`\n\nThe young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments\nthey were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them\nbreathe.\n\n`I think I do,` said the gentleman, breaking silence.  `I should\nby your description.  We shall see.  Many people are singularly\nlike each other.  It may not be the same.`\n\nAs he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed\ncarelessness, he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as\nthe latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard\nhim mutter, `It must be he!`\n\n`Now,` he said, returning:  so it seemed by the sound:  to the\nspot where he had stood before, `you have given us most valuable\nassistance, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it.\nWhat can I do to serve you?`\n\n`Nothing,` replied Nancy.\n\n`You will not persist in saying that,` rejoined the gentleman,\nwith a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a\nmuch harder and more obdurate heart. `Think now.  Tell me.`\n\n`Nothing, sir,` rejoined the girl, weeping.  `You can do nothing\nto help me.  I am past all hope, indeed.`\n"}

Look at that\ndark water.  How many times do you read of such as I who spring\ninto the tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail\nthem.  It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I\nshall come to that at last.`\n\n`Do not speak thus, pray,` returned the young lady, sobbing.\n\n`It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such\nhorrors should!` replied the girl.  `Good-night, good-night!`\n\nThe gentleman turned away.\n\n`This purse,` cried the young lady.  `Take it for my sake, that\nyou may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.`\n\n`No!` replied the girl.  `I have not done this for money.

There.  Bless you!

They stopped at the summit\nof the stairs.\n\n`Hark!` cried the young lady, listening.  `Did she call!  I\nthought I heard her voice.`\n\n`No, my love,` replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. `She has\nnot moved, and will not till we are gone.`\n\nRose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through\nhis, and led her, with gentle force, away.  As they disappeared,\nthe girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the\nstone stairs, and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter\ntears.\n\nAfter a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps\nascended the street.  The astonished listener remained motionless\non his post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained,\nwith many cautious glances round him, that he was again alone,\ncrept slowly from his hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and\nin the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had descended.\n\nPeeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make\nsure that he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his\nutmost speed, and made for the Jew`s house as fast as his legs\nwould carry him.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nFATAL CONSEQUENCES\n\nIt was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the\nautumn of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when\nthe streets are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to\nslumber, and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it\nwas at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his\nold lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and\nblood-shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some\nhideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil\nspirit.\n\nHe sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn\ncoverlet, with his face turned towards a wasting candle that\nstood upon a table by his side.  His right hand was raised to his\nlips, and as, absorbed in thought, he hit his long black nails,\nhe disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should\nhave been a dog`s or rat`s.\n\nStretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast\nasleep.  Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for\nan instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which\nwith a long-burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease\nfalling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his\nthoughts were busy elsewhere.\n\nIndeed they were.  Mortification at the overthrow of his notable\nscheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with\nstrangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to\nyield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on\nSikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce\nand deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate\nconsiderations which, following close upon each other with rapid\nand ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every\nevil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart.\n\nHe sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing\nto take the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to\nbe attracted by a footstep in the street.\n\n`At last,` he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. `At\nlast!`\n\nThe bell rang gently as he spoke.  He crept upstairs to the door,\nand presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin,\nwho carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing\nback his outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.\n\n`There!` he said, laying the bundle on the table.  `Take care of\nthat, and do the most you can with it.  It`s been trouble enough\nto get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.`\n\nFagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the\ncupboard, sat down again without speaking.  But he did not take\nhis eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and\nnow that they sat over against each other, face to face, he\nlooked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and\nhis face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that\nthe housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed\nhim with a look of real affright.\n\n`Wot now?` cried Sikes.  `Wot do you look at a man so for?`\n\nFagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger\nin the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of\nspeech was for the moment gone.\n\n`Damme!` said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm.\n`He`s gone mad.  I must look to myself here.`\n\n`No, no,` rejoined Fagin, finding his voice.  `It`s not--you`re\nnot the person, Bill.  I`ve no--no fault to find with you.`\n\n`Oh, you haven`t, haven`t you?` said Sikes, looking sternly at\nhim, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient\npocket.  `That`s lucky--for one of us.  Which one that is, don`t\nmatter.`\n\n`I`ve got that to tell you, Bill,` said Fagin, drawing his chair\nnearer, `will make you worse than me.`\n\n`Aye?` returned the robber with an incredulous air.  `Tell away!\nLook sharp, or Nance will think I`m lost.`\n\n`Lost!` cried Fagin.  `She has pretty well settled that, in her\nown mind, already.`\n\nSikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew`s\nface, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle\nthere, clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him\nsoundly.\n\n`Speak, will you!` he said; `or if you don`t, it shall be for\nwant of breath.  Open your mouth and say wot you`ve got to say in\nplain words.  Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!`\n\n`Suppose that lad that`s laying there--` Fagin began.\n\nSikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not\npreviously observed him.  `Well!` he said, resuming his former\nposition.\n\n`Suppose that lad,` pursued Fagin, `was to peach--to blow upon us\nall--first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then\nhaving a meeting with `em in the street to paint our likenesses,\ndescribe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib\nwhere we might be most easily taken.  Suppose he was to do all\nthis, and besides to blow upon a plant we`ve all been in, more or\nless--of his own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by\nthe parson and brought to it on bread and water,--but of his own\nfancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at nights to find\nthose most interested against us, and peaching to them.  Do you\nhear me?` cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage.  `Suppose\nhe did all this, what then?`\n\n`What then!` replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath.  `If he was\nleft alive till I came, I`d grind his skull under the iron heel\nof my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.`\n\n`What if I did it!` cried Fagin almost in a yell.  `I, that knows\nso much, and could hang so many besides myself!`\n\n`I don`t know,` replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning\nwhite at the mere suggestion.  `I`d do something in the jail that\n`ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I`d\nfall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains\nout afore the people. I should have such strength,` muttered the\nrobber, poising his brawny arm, `that I could smash your head as\nif a loaded waggon had gone over it.`\n\n`You would?`\n\n`Would I!` said the housebreaker.  `Try me.`\n\n`If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or--`\n\n`I don`t care who,` replied Sikes impatiently.  `Whoever it was,\nI`d serve them the same.`\n\nFagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent,\nstooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to\nrouse him.  Sikes leant forward in his chair:  looking on with\nhis hands upon his knees, as if wondering much what all this\nquestioning and preparation was to end in.\n\n`Bolter, Bolter!  Poor lad!` said Fagin, looking up with an\nexpression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with\nmarked emphasis.  `He`s tired--tired with watching for her so\nlong,--watching for _her_, Bill.`\n\n`Wot d`ye mean?` asked Sikes, drawing back.\n\nFagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled\nhim into a sitting posture.  When his assumed name had been\nrepeated several times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy\nyawn, looked sleepily about him.\n\n`Tell me that again--once again, just for him to hear,` said the\nJew, pointing to Sikes as he spoke.\n\n`Tell yer what?` asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.\n\n`That about-- _Nancy_,` said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as\nif to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough.\n`You followed her?`\n\n`Yes.`\n\n`To London Bridge?`\n\n`Yes.`\n"}

She did all\nthis.  She told it all every word without a threat, without a\nmurmur--she did--did she not?` cried Fagin, half mad with fury.\n\n`All right,` replied Noah, scratching his head.  `That`s just\nwhat it was!`\n\n`What did they say, about last Sunday?`\n\n`About last Sunday!` replied Noah, considering.  `Why I told yer\nthat before.`\n\n`Again.  Tell it again!` cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on\nSikes, and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew\nfrom his lips.\n\n`They asked her,` said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed\nto have a dawning perception who Sikes was, `they asked her why\nshe didn`t come, last Sunday, as she promised.  She said she\ncouldn`t.`\n\n`Why--why?  Tell him that.`\n\n`Because she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had\ntold them of before,` replied Noah.\n\n`What more of him?` cried Fagin.  `What more of the man she had\ntold them of before?  Tell him that, tell him that.`\n\n`Why, that she couldn`t very easily get out of doors unless he\nknew where she was going to,` said Noah; `and so the first time\nshe went to see the lady, she--ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when\nshe said it, that it did--she gave him a drink of laudanum.`\n\n`Hell`s fire!` cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.  `Let\nme go!`\n\nFlinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and\ndarted, wildly and furiously, up the stairs.\n\n`Bill, Bill!` cried Fagin, following him hastily.  `A word. Only\na word.`\n\nThe word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker\nwas unable to open the door:  on which he was expending fruitless\noaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up.\n\n`Let me out,` said Sikes.  `Don`t speak to me; it`s not safe.\nLet me out, I say!`\n\n`Hear me speak a word,` rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the\nlock.  `You won`t be--`\n\n`Well,` replied the other.\n\n`You won`t be--too--violent, Bill?`\n\nThe day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to\nsee each other`s faces.  They exchanged one brief glance; there\nwas a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.\n\n`I mean,` said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now\nuseless, `not too violent for safety.  Be crafty, Bill, and not\ntoo bold.`\n\nSikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin\nhad turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.\n\nWithout one pause, or moment`s consideration; without once\nturning his head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the\nsky, or lowering them to the ground, but looking straight before\nhim with savage resolution:  his teeth so tightly compressed that\nthe strained jaw seemed starting through his skin; the robber\nheld on his headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a\nmuscle, until he reached his own door.  He opened it, softly,\nwith a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering his own\nroom, double-locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against\nit, drew back the curtain of the bed.\n\nThe girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it.  He had roused her\nfrom her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and\nstartled look.\n\n`Get up!` said the man.\n\n`It is you, Bill!` said the girl, with an expression of pleasure\nat his return.\n\n`It is,` was the reply.  `Get up.`\n\nThere was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the\ncandlestick, and hurled it under the grate.  Seeing the faint\nlight of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.\n\n`Let it be,` said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. `There`s\nenough light for wot I`ve got to do.`\n\n`Bill,` said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, `why do you\nlook like that at me!`\n\nThe robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated\nnostrils and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head\nand throat, dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking\nonce towards the door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth.\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nTHE FLIGHT OF SIKES\n\nOf all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been\ncommitted within wide London`s bounds since night hung over it,\nthat was the worst.  Of all the horrors that rose with an ill\nscent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel.\n\nThe sun--the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but\nnew life, and hope, and freshness to man--burst upon the crowded\ncity in clear and radiant glory.  Through costly-coloured glass\nand paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten\ncrevice, it shed its equal ray.  It lighted up the room where the\nmurdered woman lay.  It did.  He tried to shut it out, but it\nwould stream in.  If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull\nmorning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light!\n\nHe had not moved; he had been afraid to stir.  There had been a\nmoan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he\nhad struck and struck again.  Once he threw a rug over it; but it\nwas worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him,\nthan to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of\nthe pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the\nceiling.  He had plucked it off again.  And there was the\nbody--mere flesh and blood, no more--but such flesh, and so much\nblood!\n\nHe struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it.\nThere was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light\ncinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney.  Even\nthat frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon\ntill it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and\nsmoulder into ashes.  He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes;\nthere were spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces\nout, and burnt them.  How those stains were dispersed about the\nroom!  The very feet of the dog were bloody.\n\nAll this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the\ncorpse; no, not for a moment.  Such preparations completed, he\nmoved, backward, towards the door:  dragging the dog with him,\nlest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of\nthe crime into the streets. He shut the door softly, locked it,\ntook the key, and left the house.\n\nHe crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that\nnothing was visible from the outside.  There was the curtain\nstill drawn, which she would have opened to admit the light she\nnever saw again.  It lay nearly under there.  _He_ knew that.  God,\nhow the sun poured down upon the very spot!\n\nThe glance was instantaneous.  It was a relief to have got free\nof the room.  He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.\n\nHe went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on\nwhich stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to\nHighgate Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go;\nstruck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to\ndescend it; and taking the foot-path across the fields, skirted\nCaen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath.  Traversing the hollow\nby the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing\nthe road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made\nalong the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North\nEnd, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and\nslept.\n\nSoon he was up again, and away,--not far into the country, but\nback towards London by the high-road--then back again--then over\nanother part of the same ground as he already traversed--then\nwandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches` brinks to\nrest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the\nsame, and ramble on again.\n\nWhere could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some\nmeat and drink?  Hendon.  That was a good place, not far off, and\nout of most people`s way.  Thither he directed his\nsteps,--running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange\nperversity, loitering at a snail`s pace, or stopping altogether\nand idly breaking the hedges with a stick.  But when he got\nthere, all the people he met--the very children at the\ndoors--seemed to view him with suspicion.  Back he turned again,\nwithout the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted\nno food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath,\nuncertain where to go.\n\nHe wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back\nto the old place.  Morning and noon had passed, and the day was\non the wane, and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down,\nand round and round, and still lingered about the same spot.  At\nlast he got away, and shaped his course for Hatfield.\n\nIt was nine o`clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and\nthe dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned\ndown the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding\nalong the little street, crept into a small public-house, whose\nscanty light had guided them to the spot.  There was a fire in\nthe tap-room, and some country-labourers were drinking before it.\n\nThey made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest\ncorner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog:  to whom\nhe cast a morsel of food from time to time.\n\nThe conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the\nneighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were\nexhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on\nthe previous Sunday; the young men present considering him very\nold, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite\nyoung--not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he\nwas--with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least--if he had\ntaken care; if he had taken care.\n\nThere was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this.\nThe robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed\nin his corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half\nwakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer.\n\nThis was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who\ntravelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors,\nwashballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap\nperfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a\ncase slung to his back.  His entrance was the signal for various\nhomely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he\nhad made his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he\ningeniously contrived to unite business with amusement.\n\n`And what be that stoof?  Good to eat, Harry?` asked a grinning\ncountryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.\n\n`This,` said the fellow, producing one, `this is the infallible\nand invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust,\ndirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin,\nlinen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin,\nbombazeen, or woollen stuff.  Wine-stains, fruit-stains,\nbeer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, any\nstains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and\ninvaluable composition.  If a lady stains her honour, she has\nonly need to swallow one cake and she`s cured at once--for it`s\npoison.  If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to\nbolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question--for\nit`s quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal\nnastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking\nit.  One penny a square.  With all these virtues, one penny a\nsquare!`\n"}

He almost knew what was to come; but he\ncrossed over, and listened.\n\nThe guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag.\nA man, dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he\nhanded him a basket which lay ready on the pavement.\n\n`That`s for your people,` said the guard.  `Now, look alive in\nthere, will you.  Damn that `ere bag, it warn`t ready night afore\nlast; this won`t do, you know!`\n\n`Anything new up in town, Ben?` asked the game-keeper, drawing\nback to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.\n\n`No, nothing that I knows on,` replied the man, pulling on his\ngloves.  `Corn`s up a little.  I heerd talk of a murder, too,\ndown Spitalfields way, but I don`t reckon much upon it.`\n\n`Oh, that`s quite true,` said a gentleman inside, who was looking\nout of the window.  `And a dreadful murder it was.`\n\n`Was it, sir?` rejoined the guard, touching his hat.  `Man or\nwoman, pray, sir?`\n\n`A woman,` replied the gentleman.  `It is supposed--`\n\n`Now, Ben,` replied the coachman impatiently.\n\n`Damn that `ere bag,` said the guard; `are you gone to sleep in\nthere?`\n\n`Coming!` cried the office keeper, running out.\n\n`Coming,` growled the guard.  `Ah, and so`s the young `ooman of\nproperty that`s going to take a fancy to me, but I don`t know\nwhen.  Here, give hold.  All ri--ight!`\n\nThe horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.\n\nSikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what\nhe had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a\ndoubt where to go.  At length he went back again, and took the\nroad which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans.\n\nHe went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and\nplunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a\ndread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core.\nEvery object before him, substance or shadow, still or moving,\ntook the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were\nnothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning`s\nghastly figure following at his heels.  He could trace its shadow\nin the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note\nhow stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along.  He could hear its\ngarments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came\nladen with that last low cry.  If he stopped it did the same.  If\nhe ran, it followed--not running too:  that would have been a\nrelief:  but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of\nlife, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or\nfell.\n\nAt times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to\nbeat this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the\nhair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had\nturned with him and was behind him then.  He had kept it before\nhim that morning, but it was behind now--always.  He leaned his\nback against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly\nout against the cold night-sky.  He threw himself upon the\nroad--on his back upon the road.  At his head it stood, silent,\nerect, and still--a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in\nblood.\n\nLet no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that\nProvidence must sleep.  There were twenty score of violent deaths\nin one long minute of that agony of fear.\n\nThere was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for\nthe night.  Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which\nmade it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a\ndismal wail.  He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and\nhere he stretched himself close to the wall--to undergo new\ntorture.\n\nFor now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible\nthan that from which he had escaped.  Those widely staring eyes,\nso lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them\nthan think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness:\nlight in themselves, but giving light to nothing.  There were but\ntwo, but they were everywhere.  If he shut out the sight, there\ncame the room with every well-known object--some, indeed, that he\nwould have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from\nmemory--each in its accustomed place.  The body was in _its_ place,\nand its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away.  He got up,\nand rushed into the field without.  The figure was behind him.\nHe re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more.  The eyes were\nthere, before he had laid himself along.\n\nAnd here he remained in such terror as none but he can know,\ntrembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every\npore, when suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of\ndistant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and\nwonder.  Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it\nconveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him.  He\nregained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal\ndanger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air.\n\nThe broad sky seemed on fire.  Rising into the air with showers\nof sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame,\nlighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of\nsmoke in the direction where he stood.  The shouts grew louder as\nnew voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire!\nmingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy\nbodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new\nobstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food.  The noise\nincreased as he looked.  There were people there--men and\nwomen--light, bustle.  It was like new life to him.  He darted\nonward--straight, headlong--dashing through brier and brake, and\nleaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with\nloud and sounding bark before him.\n\nHe came upon the spot.  There were half-dressed figures tearing\nto and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from\nthe stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and\nout-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst\na shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot\nbeams.  The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago,\ndisclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into\nthe burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white\nhot, upon the ground.  Women and children shrieked, and men\nencouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers.  The clanking\nof the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as\nit fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar.  He\nshouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and\nhimself, plunged into the thickest of the throng.  Hither and\nthither he dived that night:  now working at the pumps, and now\nhurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage\nhimself wherever noise and men were thickest.  Up and down the\nladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and\ntrembled with his weight, under the lee of falling bricks and\nstones, in every part of that great fire was he; but he bore a\ncharmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness\nnor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and\nblackened ruins remained.\n"}

{"text":"\nThis mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force,\nthe dreadful consciousness of his crime.  He looked suspiciously\nabout him, for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared\nto be the subject of their talk.  The dog obeyed the significant\nbeck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together.  He\npassed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called\nto him to share in their refreshment.  He took some bread and\nmeat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who\nwere from London, talking about the murder.  `He has gone to\nBirmingham, they say,` said one:  `but they`ll have him yet, for\nthe scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there`ll be a cry all\nthrough the country.`\n\nHe hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the\nground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and\nuneasy sleep.  He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided,\nand oppressed with the fear of another solitary night.\n\nSuddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to\nLondon.\n\n`There`s somebody to speak to there, at all event,` he thought.\n`A good hiding-place, too.  They`ll never expect to nab me there,\nafter this country scent.  Why can`t I lie by for a week or so,\nand, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France?  Damme, I`ll\nrisk it.`\n\nHe acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least\nfrequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie\nconcealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and,\nentering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to\nthat part of it which he had fixed on for his destination.\n\nThe dog, though.  If any description of him were out, it would\nnot be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone\nwith him.  This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along\nthe streets.  He resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking\nabout for a pond:  picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his\nhandkerchief as he went.\n\nThe animal looked up into his master`s face while these\npreparations were making; whether his instinct apprehended\nsomething of their purpose, or the robber`s sidelong look at him\nwas sterner than ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the\nrear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly along.  When\nhis master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to\ncall him, he stopped outright.\n\n`Do you hear me call?  Come here!` cried Sikes.\n\nThe animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes\nstooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a\nlow growl and started back.\n\n`Come back!` said the robber.\n\nThe dog wagged his tail, but moved not.  Sikes made a running\nnoose and called him again.\n\nThe dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away\nat his hardest speed.\n\nThe man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the\nexpectation that he would return.  But no dog appeared, and at\nlength he resumed his journey.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nMONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET.  THEIR CONVERSATION, AND\nTHE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT\n\n The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow\nalighted from a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked\nsoftly.  The door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach\nand stationed himself on one side of the steps, while another\nman, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood\nupon the other side.  At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped\nout a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into\nthe house. This man was Monks.\n\nThey walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking,\nand Mr. Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room.\nAt the door of this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with\nevident reluctance, stopped.  The two men looked at the old\ngentleman as if for instructions.\n\n`He knows the alternative,` said Mr. Browlow.  `If he hesitates\nor moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street,\ncall for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my\nname.`\n\n`How dare you say this of me?` asked Monks.\n\n`How dare you urge me to it, young man?` replied Mr. Brownlow,\nconfronting him with a steady look.  `Are you mad enough to leave\nthis house?  Unhand him.  There, sir. You are free to go, and we\nto follow.  But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most\nsacred, that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of\nfraud and robbery.  I am resolute and immoveable.  If you are\ndetermined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!`\n\n`By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here\nby these dogs?` asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the\nmen who stood beside him.\n\n`By mine,` replied Mr. Brownlow.  `Those persons are indemnified\nby me.  If you complain of being deprived of your liberty--you\nhad power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but\nyou deemed it advisable to remain quiet--I say again, throw\nyourself for protection on the law.  I will appeal to the law\ntoo; but when you have gone too far to recede, do not sue to me\nfor leniency, when the power will have passed into other hands;\nand do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed,\nyourself.`\n\nMonks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides.  He\nhesitated.\n\n`You will decide quickly,` said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect\nfirmness and composure.  `If you wish me to prefer my charges\npublicly, and consign you to a punishment the extent of which,\nalthough I can, with a shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once\nmore, I say, for you know the way.  If not, and you appeal to my\nforbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat\nyourself, without a word, in that chair.  It has waited for you\ntwo whole days.`\n\nMonks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.\n\n`You will be prompt,` said Mr. Brownlow.  `A word from me, and\nthe alternative has gone for ever.`\n\nStill the man hesitated.\n\n`I have not the inclination to parley,` said Mr. Brownlow, `and,\nas I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the\nright.`\n\n`Is there--` demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,--`is\nthere--no middle course?`\n\n`None.`\n\nMonks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but,\nreading in his countenance nothing but severity and\ndetermination, walked into the room, and, shrugging his\nshoulders, sat down.\n\n`Lock the door on the outside,` said Mr. Brownlow to the\nattendants, `and come when I ring.`\n\nThe men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.\n\n`This is pretty treatment, sir,` said Monks, throwing down his\nhat and cloak, `from my father`s oldest friend.`\n\n`It is because I was your father`s oldest friend, young man,`\nreturned Mr. Brownlow; `it is because the hopes and wishes of\nyoung and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair\ncreature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth,\nand left me here a solitary, lonely man:  it is because he knelt\nwith me beside his only sisters` death-bed when he was yet a boy,\non the morning that would--but Heaven willed otherwise--have made\nher my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him,\nfrom that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he\ndied; it is because old recollections and associations filled my\nheart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of\nhim; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat\nyou gently now--yes, Edward Leeford, even now--and blush for your\nunworthiness who bear the name.`\n\n`What has the name to do with it?` asked the other, after\ncontemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the\nagitation of his companion.  `What is the name to me?`\n\n`Nothing,` replied Mr. Brownlow, `nothing to you.  But it was\n_hers_, and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old\nman, the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it\nrepeated by a stranger.  I am very glad you have changed\nit--very--very.`\n\n`This is all mighty fine,` said Monks (to retain his assumed\ndesignation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked\nhimself in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat,\nshading his face with his hand. `But what do you want with me?`\n\n`You have a brother,` said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself:  `a\nbrother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind\nyou in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you\naccompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.`\n\n`I have no brother,` replied Monks.  `You know I was an only\nchild.  Why do you talk to me of brothers?  You know that, as\nwell as I.`\n\n`Attend to what I do know, and you may not,` said Mr. Brownlow.\n`I shall interest you by and by.  I know that of the wretched\nmarriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and\nnarrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere\nboy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.`\n\n`I don`t care for hard names,` interrupted Monks with a jeering\nlaugh.  `You know the fact, and that`s enough for me.`\n\n`But I also know,` pursued the old gentleman, `the misery, the\nslow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union.\nI know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair\ndragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to\nthem both.  I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open\ntaunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike to hate,\nand hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking\nbond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a\ngalling fragment, of which nothing but death could break the\nrivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they\ncould assume.  Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon.  But it\nrusted and cankered at your father`s heart for years.`\n\n`Well, they were separated,` said Monks, `and what of that?`\n\n`When they had been separated for some time,` returned Mr.\nBrownlow, `and your mother, wholly given up to continental\nfrivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good\nyears her junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at\nhome, he fell among new friends.  This circumstance, at least,\nyou know already.`\n\n`Not I,` said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot\nupon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything.\n`Not I.`\n\n`Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have\nnever forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,`\nreturned Mr. Brownlow.  `I speak of fifteen years ago, when you\nwere not more than eleven years old, and your father but\none-and-thirty--for he was, I repeat, a boy, when _his_ father\nordered him to marry. Must I go back to events which cast a shade\nupon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and\ndisclose to me the truth?`\n\n`I have nothing to disclose,` rejoined Monks.  `You must talk on\nif you will.`\n\n`These new friends, then,` said Mr. Brownlow, `were a naval\nofficer retired from active service, whose wife had died some\nhalf-a-year before, and left him with two children--there had\nbeen more, but, of all their family, happily but two survived.\nThey were both daughters; one a beautiful creature of nineteen,\nand the other a mere child of two or three years old.`\n\n`What`s this to me?` asked Monks.\n"}

{"text":"\n`They resided,` said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the\ninterruption, `in a part of the country to which your father in\nhis wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.\nAcquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other.\nYour father was gifted as few men are.  He had his sister`s soul\nand person.  As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew\nto love him.  I would that it had ended there.  His daughter did\nthe same.`\n\nThe old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his\neyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:\n\n`The end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to\nthat daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only\npassion of a guileless girl.`\n\n`Your tale is of the longest,` observed Monks, moving restlessly\nin his chair.\n\n`It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,`\nreturned Mr. Brownlow, `and such tales usually are; if it were\none of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief.  At\nlength one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest\nand importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are\noften--it is no uncommon case--died, and to repair the misery he\nhad been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea for\nall griefs--Money.  It was necessary that he should immediately\nrepair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where\nhe had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion.  He went;\nwas seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment\nthe intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you\nwith her; he died the day after her arrival, leaving no will--_no will_\n--so that the whole property fell to her and you.`\n\nAt this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened\nwith a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not\ndirected towards the speaker.  As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed\nhis position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden\nrelief, and wiped his hot face and hands.\n\n`Before he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his\nway,` said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the\nother`s face, `he came to me.`\n\n`I never heard of that,` interrupted MOnks in a tone intended to\nappear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.\n\n`He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a\npicture--a portrait painted by himself--a likeness of this poor\ngirl--which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry\nforward on his hasty journey.  He was worn by anxiety and remorse\nalmost to a shadow; talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and\ndishonour worked by himself; confided to me his intention to\nconvert his whole property, at any loss, into money, and, having\nsettled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition,\nto fly the country--I guessed too well he would not fly\nalone--and never see it more.  Even from me, his old and early\nfriend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that\ncovered one most dear to both--even from me he withheld any more\nparticular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and\nafter that to see me once again, for the last time on earth.\nAlas!  _That_ was the last time.  I had no letter, and I never saw\nhim more.`\n\n`I went,` said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, `I went, when\nall was over, to the scene of his--I will use the term the world\nwould freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike\nto him--of his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were\nrealised that erring child should find one heart and home to\nshelter and compassionate her.  The family had left that part a\nweek before; they had called in such trifling debts as were\noutstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night.  Why,\nor whither, none can tell.`\n\nMonks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a\nsmile of triumph.\n\n`When your brother,` said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the\nother`s chair, `When your brother:  a feeble, ragged, neglected\nchild:  was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and\nrescued by me from a life of vice and infamy--`\n\n`What?` cried Monks.\n\n`By me,` said Mr. Brownlow.  `I told you I should interest you\nbefore long.  I say by me--I see that your cunning associate\nsuppressed my name, although for ought he knew, it would be quite\nstrange to your ears.  When he was rescued by me, then, and lay\nrecovering from sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to\nthis picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment.  Even\nwhen I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there was a\nlingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse\nof some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream.  I need not\ntell you he was snared away before I knew his history--`\n\n`Why not?` asked Monks hastily.\n\n`Because you know it well.`\n\n`I!`\n\n`Denial to me is vain,` replied Mr. Brownlow.  `I shall show you\nthat I know more than that.`\n\n`You--you--can`t prove anything against me,` stammered Monks.  `I\ndefy you to do it!`\n\n`We shall see,` returned the old gentleman with a searching\nglance.  `I lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover\nhim.  Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve\nthe mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you\nyou were on your own estate in the West Indies--whither, as you\nwell know, you retired upon your mother`s death to escape the\nconsequences of vicious courses here--I made the voyage.  You had\nleft it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but no\none could tell where.  I returned.  Your agents had no clue to\nyour residence.  You came and went, they said, as strangely as\nyou had ever done:  sometimes for days together and sometimes not\nfor months:  keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and\nmingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates\nwhen a fierce ungovernable boy.  I wearied them with new\napplications.  I paced the streets by night and day, but until\ntwo hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you\nfor an instant.`\n\n`And now you do see me,` said Monks, rising boldly, `what then?\nFraud and robbery are high-sounding words--justified, you think,\nby a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a\ndead man`s Brother!  You don`t even know that a child was born of\nthis maudlin pair; you don`t even know that.`\n\n`I _did not_,` replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; `but within the\nlast fortnight I have learnt it all.  You have a brother; you\nknow it, and him.  There was a will, which your mother destroyed,\nleaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death.  It\ncontained a reference to some child likely to be the result of\nthis sad connection, which child was born, and accidentally\nencountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by\nhis resemblance to your father.  You repaired to the place of his\nbirth. There existed proofs--proofs long suppressed--of his birth\nand parentage.  Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in\nyour own words to your accomplice the Jew, \"_the only proofs of the\nboy`s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag\nthat received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.\"\nUnworthy son, coward, liar,--you, who hold your councils with\nthieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,--you, whose plots\nand wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth\nmillions such as you,--you, who from your cradle were gall and\nbitterness to your own father`s heart, and in whom all evil\npassions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent\nin a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to\nyour mind--you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!`\n\n`No, no, no!` returned the coward, overwhelmed by these\naccumulated charges.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Every word!` cried the gentleman, `every word that has passed\nbetween you and this detested villain, is known to me.  Shadows\non the wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my\near; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself,\nand given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue.\nMurder has been done, to which you were morally if not really a\nparty.`\n\n`No, no,` interposed Monks.  `I--I knew nothing of that; I was\ngoing to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me.  I\ndidn`t know the cause.  I thought it was a common quarrel.`\n\n`It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,` replied Mr.\nBrownlow.  `Will you disclose the whole?`\n\n`Yes, I will.`\n\n`Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it\nbefore witnesses?`\n\n`That I promise too.`\n\n`Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and\nproceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for\nthe purpose of attesting it?`\n\n`If you insist upon that, I`ll do that also,` replied Monks.\n\n`You must do more than that,` said Mr. Brownlow.  `Make\nrestitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is,\nalthough the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love.  You\nhave not forgotten the provisions of the will.  Carry them into\nexecution so far as your brother is concerned, and then go where\nyou please.  In this world you need meet no more.`\n\nWhile Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil\nlooks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it:  torn\nby his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other:  the\ndoor was hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne)\nentered the room in violent agitation.\n\n`The man will be taken,` he cried.  `He will be taken to-night!`\n\n`The murderer?` asked Mr. Brownlow.\n\n`Yes, yes,` replied the other.  `His dog has been seen lurking\nabout some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master\neither is, or will be, there, under cover of the darkness.  Spies\nare hovering about in every direction.  I have spoken to the men\nwho are charged with his capture, and they tell me he cannot\nescape.  A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government\nto-night.`\n\n`I will give fifty more,` said Mr. Brownlow, `and proclaim it\nwith my own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it.  Where is Mr.\nMaylie?`\n\n`Harry?  As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach\nwith you, he hurried off to where he heard this,` replied the\ndoctor, `and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first\nparty at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.`\n\n`Fagin,` said Mr. Brownlow; `what of him?`\n\n`When I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is,\nby this time.  They`re sure of him.`\n\n`Have you made up your mind?` asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice,\nof Monks.\n\n`Yes,` he replied.  `You--you--will be secret with me?`\n\n`I will.  Remain here till I return.  It is your only hope of\nsafety.`\n\nThey left the room, and the door was again locked.\n\n`What have you done?` asked the doctor in a whisper.\n\n`All that I could hope to do, and even more.  Coupling the poor\ngirl`s intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of\nour good friend`s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole\nof escape, and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights\nbecame plain as day.  Write and appoint the evening after\nto-morrow, at seven, for the meeting.  We shall be down there, a\nfew hours before, but shall require rest:  especially the young\nlady, who _may_ have greater need of firmness than either you or I\ncan quite foresee just now.  But my blood boils to avenge this\npoor murdered creature.  Which way have they taken?`\n\n`Drive straight to the office and you will be in time,` replied\nMr. Losberne.  `I will remain here.`\n\nThe two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of\nexcitement wholly uncontrollable.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER L\n\nTHE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE\n\nNear to that part of the Thames on which the church at\nRotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest\nand the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers\nand the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the\nfilthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many\nlocalities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by\nname, to the great mass of its inhabitants.\n\nTo reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze\nof close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and\npoorest of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may\nbe supposed to occasion.  The cheapest and least delicate\nprovisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest\narticles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman`s door, and\nstream from the house-parapet and windows.  Jostling with\nunemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast-heavers,\ncoal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and\nrefuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along,\nassailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys\nwhich branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash\nof ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from\nthe stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner.  Arriving,\nat length, in streets remoter and less-frequented than those\nthrough which he has passed, he walks beneath tottering\nhouse-fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that\nseem to totter as he passes, chimneys half crushed half\nhesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time\nand dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign of\ndesolation and neglect.\n\nIn such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of\nSouthwark, stands Jacob`s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch,\nsix or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide\nis in, once called Mill Pond, but known in the days of this story\nas Folly Ditch.  It is a creek or inlet from the Thames, and can\nalways be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead\nMills from which it took its old name.  At such times, a\nstranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it\nat Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either\nside lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails,\ndomestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up;\nand when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses\nthemselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene\nbefore him.  Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a\ndozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime\nbeneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on\nwhich to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so\nfilthy, so confined, that the air would seem too tainted even for\nthe dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers\nthrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall\ninto it--as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying\nfoundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every\nloathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these\nornament the banks of Folly Ditch.\n\nIn Jacob`s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the\nwalls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the\ndoors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened,\nbut they yield no smoke.  Thirty or forty years ago, before\nlosses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place;\nbut now it is a desolate island indeed.  The houses have no\nowners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have\nthe courage; and there they live, and there they die.  They must\nhave powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a\ndestitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob`s Island.\n\nIn an upper room of one of these houses--a detached house of fair\nsize, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door\nand window:  of which house the back commanded the ditch in\nmanner already described--there were assembled three men, who,\nregarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of\nperplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and\ngloomy silence.  One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr.\nChitling, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had\nbeen almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a\nfrightful scar which might probably be traced to the same\noccasion.  This man was a returned transport, and his name was\nKags.\n\n`I wish,` said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, `that you had picked\nout some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had\nnot come here, my fine feller.`\n\n`Why didn`t you, blunder-head!` said Kags.\n\n`Well, I thought you`d have been a little more glad to see me\nthan this,` replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.\n\n`Why, look`e, young gentleman,` said Toby, `when a man keeps\nhimself so very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has\na snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling\nabout it, it`s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a\nwisit from a young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a\nperson he may be to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced\nas you are.`\n\n`Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend\nstopping with him, that`s arrived sooner than was expected from\nforeign parts, and is too modest to want to be presented to the\nJudges on his return,` added Mr. Kags.\n\nThere was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to\nabandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual\ndevil-may-care swagger, turned to Chitling and said,\n\n`When was Fagin took then?`\n\n`Just at dinner-time--two o`clock this afternoon.  Charley and I\nmade our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the\nempty water-butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious\nlong that they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.`\n\n`And Bet?`\n\n`Poor Bet!  She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,`\nreplied Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, `and\nwent off mad, screaming and raving, and beating her head against\nthe boards; so they put a strait-weskut on her and took her to\nthe hospital--and there she is.`\n\n`Wot`s come of young Bates?` demanded Kags.\n\n`He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he`ll be\nhere soon,` replied Chitling.  `There`s nowhere else to go to\nnow, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the\nbar of the ken--I went up there and see it with my own eyes--is\nfilled with traps.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`This is a smash,` observed Toby, biting his lips. `There`s more\nthan one will go with this.`\n\n`The sessions are on,` said Kags:  `if they get the inquest over,\nand Bolter turns King`s evidence:  as of course he will, from\nwhat he`s said already:  they can prove Fagin an accessory before\nthe fact, and get the trial on on Friday, and he`ll swing in six\ndays from this, by G--!`\n\n`You should have heard the people groan,` said Chitling; `the\nofficers fought like devils, or they`d have torn him away.  He\nwas down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their\nway along.  You should have seen how he looked about him, all\nmuddy and bleeding, and clung to them as if they were his dearest\nfriends.  I can see `em now, not able to stand upright with the\npressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst `em; I can see\nthe people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with\ntheir teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair\nand beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked\nthemselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and\nswore they`d tear his heart out!`\n\nThe horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon\nhis ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to\nand fro, like one distracted.\n\nWhile he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with\ntheir eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon\nthe stairs, and Sikes`s dog bounded into the room.  They ran to\nthe window, downstairs, and into the street.  The dog had jumped\nin at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was\nhis master to be seen.\n\n`What`s the meaning of this?` said Toby when they had returned.\n`He can`t be coming here.  I--I--hope not.`\n\n`If he was coming here, he`d have come with the dog,` said Kags,\nstooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the\nfloor.  `Here!  Give us some water for him; he has run himself\nfaint.`\n\n`He`s drunk it all up, every drop,` said Chitling after watching\nthe dog some time in silence.  `Covered with mud--lame--half\nblind--he must have come a long way.`\n\n`Where can he have come from!` exclaimed Toby.  `He`s been to the\nother kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come\non here, where he`s been many a time and often.  But where can he\nhave come from first, and how comes he here alone without the\nother!`\n\n`He`--(none of them called the murderer by his old name)--`He\ncan`t have made away with himself.  What do you think?` said\nChitling.\n\nToby shook his head.\n\n`If he had,` said Kags, `the dog `ud want to lead us away to\nwhere he did it.  No.  I think he`s got out of the country, and\nleft the dog behind.  He must have given him the slip somehow, or\nhe wouldn`t be so easy.`\n\nThis solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as\nthe right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to\nsleep, without more notice from anybody.\n\nIt being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted\nand placed upon the table.  The terrible events of the last two\ndays had made a deep impression on all three, increased by the\ndanger and uncertainty of their own position.  They drew their\nchairs closer together, starting at every sound.  They spoke\nlittle, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken\nas if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room.\n\nThey had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried\nknocking at the door below.\n\n`Young Bates,` said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the\nfear he felt himself.\n\nThe knocking came again.  No, it wasn`t he.  He never knocked\nlike that.\n\nCrackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his\nhead.  There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face\nwas enough.  The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran\nwhining to the door.\n\n`We must let him in,` he said, taking up the candle.\n\n`Isn`t there any help for it?` asked the other man in a hoarse\nvoice.\n\n`None.  He _must_ come in.`\n\n`Don`t leave us in the dark,` said Kags, taking down a candle\nfrom the chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling\nhand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.\n\nCrackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man\nwith the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and\nanother tied over his head under his hat.  He drew them slowly\noff.  Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three\ndays` growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the very\nghost of Sikes.\n\nHe laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the\nroom, but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming\nto glance over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the\nwall--as close as it would go--and ground it against it--and sat\ndown.\n\nNot a word had been exchanged.  He looked from one to another in\nsilence.  If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was\ninstantly averted.  When his hollow voice broke silence, they all\nthree started.  They seemed never to have heard its tones before.\n\n`How came that dog here?` he asked.\n\n`Alone.  Three hours ago.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`To-night`s paper says that Fagin`s took.  Is it true, or a lie?`\n\n`True.`\n\nThey were silent again.\n\n`Damn you all!` said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead.\n\n`Have you nothing to say to me?`\n\nThere was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.\n\n`You that keep this house,` said Sikes, turning his face to\nCrackit, `do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this\nhunt is over?`\n\n`You may stop here, if you think it safe,` returned the person\naddressed, after some hesitation.\n\nSikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him:  rather\ntrying to turn his head than actually doing it:  and said,\n`Is--it--the body--is it buried?`\n\nThey shook their heads.\n\n`Why isn`t it!` he retorted with the same glance behind him.\n`Wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for?--Who`s\nthat knocking?`\n\nCrackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room,\nthat there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with\nCharley Bates behind him.  Sikes sat opposite the door, so that\nthe moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure.\n\n`Toby,` said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes\ntowards him, `why didn`t you tell me this, downstairs?`\n\nThere had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of\nthe three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even\nthis lad.  Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would\nshake hands with him.\n\n`Let me go into some other room,` said the boy, retreating still\nfarther.\n\n`Charley!` said Sikes, stepping forward.  `Don`t you--don`t you\nknow me?`\n\n`Don`t come nearer me,` answered the boy, still retreating, and\nlooking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer`s face.  `You\nmonster!`\n\nThe man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but\nSikes`s eyes sunk gradually to the ground.\n\n`Witness you three,` cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and\nbecoming more and more excited as he spoke. `Witness you\nthree--I`m not afraid of him--if they come here after him, I`ll\ngive him up; I will.  I tell you out at once.  He may kill me for\nit if he likes, or if he dares, but if I am here I`ll give him\nup.  I`d give him up if he was to be boiled alive.  Murder!\nHelp!  If there`s the pluck of a man among you three, you`ll help\nme.  Murder!  Help!  Down with him!`\n\nPouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent\ngesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed,\nupon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the\nsuddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.\n\nThe three spectators seemed quite stupefied.  They offered no\ninterference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together;\nthe former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him,\nwrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the\nmurderer`s breast, and never ceasing to call for help with all\nhis might.\n"}

{"text":"\nThe contest, however, was too unequal to last long.  Sikes had\nhim down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him\nback with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.  There were\nlights gleaming below, voices in loud and earnest conversation,\nthe tramp of hurried footsteps--endless they seemed in\nnumber--crossing the nearest wooden bridge.  One man on horseback\nseemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs\nrattling on the uneven pavement.  The gleam of lights increased;\nthe footsteps came more thickly and noisily on.  Then, came a\nloud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a\nmultitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.\n\n`Help!` shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air.\n\n`He`s here!  Break down the door!`\n\n`In the King`s name,` cried the voices without; and the hoarse\ncry arose again, but louder.\n\n`Break down the door!` screamed the boy.  `I tell you they`ll\nnever open it.  Run straight to the room where the light is.\nBreak down the door!`\n\nStrokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower\nwindow-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst\nfrom the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some\nadequate idea of its immense extent.\n\n`Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching\nHell-babe,` cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and\ndragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack.\n`That door.  Quick!`  He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the\nkey.  `Is the downstairs door fast?`\n\n`Double-locked and chained,` replied Crackit, who, with the other\ntwo men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.\n\n`The panels--are they strong?`\n\n`Lined with sheet-iron.`\n\n`And the windows too?`\n\n`Yes, and the windows.`\n\n`Damn you!` cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and\nmenacing the crowd.  `Do your worst!  I`ll cheat you yet!`\n\nOf all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none\ncould exceed the cry of the infuriated throng.  Some shouted to\nthose who were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to\nthe officers to shoot him dead.  Among them all, none showed such\nfury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the\nsaddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting\nwater, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all\nothers, `Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!`\n\nThe nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it.  Some\ncalled for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with\ntorches to and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and\nroared again; some spent their breath in impotent curses and\nexecrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and\nthus impeded the progress of those below; some among the boldest\nattempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the\nwall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a\nfield of corn moved by an angry wind:  and joined from time to\ntime in one loud furious roar.\n\n`The tide,` cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the\nroom, and shut the faces out, `the tide was in as I came up.\nGive me a rope, a long rope.  They`re all in front.  I may drop\ninto the Folly Ditch, and clear off that way.  Give me a rope, or\nI shall do three more murders and kill myself.`\n\nThe panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept;\nthe murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord,\nhurried up to the house-top.\n\nAll the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked\nup, except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked,\nand that was too small even for the passage of his body.  But,\nfrom this aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without,\nto guard the back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on\nthe house-top by the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed\nthe fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round,\npressing upon each other in an unbroken stream.\n\nHe planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the\npurpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of\ngreat difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over\nthe tiles, looked over the low parapet.\n\nThe water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.\n\nThe crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his\nmotions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they\nperceived it and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of\ntriumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had\nbeen whispers.  Again and again it rose.  Those who were at too\ngreat a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it\nechoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had\npoured its population out to curse him.\n"}

{"text":"\nOn pressed the people from the front--on, on, on, in a strong\nstruggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring\ntorch to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath\nand passion.  The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had\nbeen entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily\nout; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster\nupon cluster of people clinging to every house-top.  Each little\nbridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of\nthe crowd upon it.  Still the current poured on to find some nook\nor hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant\nsee the wretch.\n\n`They have him now,` cried a man on the nearest bridge. `Hurrah!`\n\nThe crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout\nuprose.\n\n`I will give fifty pounds,` cried an old gentleman from the same\nquarter, `to the man who takes him alive.  I will remain here,\ntill he come to ask me for it.`\n\nThere was another roar.  At this moment the word was passed among\nthe crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had\nfirst called for the ladder had mounted into the room.  The\nstream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to\nmouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the\nbridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into\nthe street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell to\nthe spot they had left:  each man crushing and striving with his\nneighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door,\nand look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out. The\ncries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to\nsuffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the\nconfusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked\nup; and at this time, between the rush of some to regain the\nspace in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of\nothers to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate\nattention was distracted from the murderer, although the\nuniversal eagerness for his capture was, if possible, increased.\n\nThe man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of\nthe crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this\nsudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he\nsprang upon his feet, determined to make one last effort for his\nlife by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being\nstifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and\nconfusion.\n\nRoused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise\nwithin the house which announced that an entrance had really been\neffected, he set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened\none end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the\nother made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and\nteeth almost in a second.  He could let himself down by the cord\nto within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and\nhad his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop.\n\nAt the very instant when he brought the loop over his head\nprevious to slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old\ngentleman before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing\nof the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his\nposition) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about\nto lower himself down--at that very instant the murderer, looking\nbehind him on the roof, threw his arms above his head, and\nuttered a yell of terror.\n\n`The eyes again!` he cried in an unearthly screech.\n\nStaggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and\ntumbled over the parapet.  The noose was on his neck. It ran up\nwith his weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it\nspeeds.  He fell for five-and-thirty feet.  There was a sudden\njerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with\nthe open knife clenched in his stiffening hand.\n\nThe old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely.\nThe murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy,\nthrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view, called\nto the people to come and take him out, for God`s sake.\n\nA dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and\nforwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting\nhimself for a spring, jumped for the dead man`s shoulders.\nMissing his aim, he fell into the ditch, turning completely over\nas he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed out his\nbrains.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER LI\n\nAFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND\nCOMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT\nOR PIN-MONEY\n\nThe events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days\nold, when Oliver found himself, at three o`clock in the\nafternoon, in a travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his\nnative town.  Mrs. Maylie, and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the\ngood doctor were with him:  and Mr. Brownlow followed in a\npost-chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not\nbeen mentioned.\n\nThey had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a\nflutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the\npower of collecting his thoughts, and almost of speech, and\nappeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who\nshared it, in at least an equal degree.  He and the two ladies\nhad been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the\nnature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks; and\nalthough they knew that the object of their present journey was\nto complete the work which had been so well begun, still the\nwhole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to\nleave them in endurance of the most intense suspense.\n\nThe same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne`s assistance,\ncautiously stopped all channels of communication through which\nthey could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that\nso recently taken place.  `It was quite true,` he said, `that\nthey must know them before long, but it might be at a better time\nthan the present, and it could not be at a worse.`  So, they\ntravelled on in silence:  each busied with reflections on the\nobject which had brought them together:  and no one disposed to\ngive utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.\n\nBut if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while\nthey journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never\nseen, how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old\ntimes, and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his\nbreast, when they turned into that which he had traversed on\nfoot:  a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help\nhim, or a roof to shelter his head.\n\n`See there, there!` cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of\nRose, and pointing out at the carriage window; `that`s the stile\nI came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any\none should overtake me and force me back!  Yonder is the path\nacross the fields, leading to the old house where I was a little\nchild!  Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if I could only see\nyou now!`\n\n`You will see him soon,` replied Rose, gently taking his folded\nhands between her own.  `You shall tell him how happy you are,\nand how rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you\nhave none so great as the coming back to make him happy too.`\n\n`Yes, yes,` said Oliver, `and we`ll--we`ll take him away from\nhere, and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet\ncountry place where he may grow strong and well,--shall we?`\n\nRose nodded `yes,` for the boy was smiling through such happy\ntears that she could not speak.\n\n`You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,`\nsaid Oliver.  `It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can\ntell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you\nwill smile again--I know that too--to think how changed he is;\nyou did the same with me.  He said \"God bless you\" to me when I\nran away,` cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion;\n`and I will say \"God bless you\" now, and show him how I love him\nfor it!`\n\nAs they approached the town, and at length drove through its\nnarrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to\nrestrain the boy within reasonable bounds.  There was\nSowerberry`s the undertaker`s just as it used to be, only smaller\nand less imposing in appearance than he remembered it--there were\nall the well-known shops and houses, with almost every one of\nwhich he had some slight incident connected--there was Gamfield`s\ncart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old\npublic-house door--there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of\nhis youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the\nstreet--there was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at\nsight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed\nat himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed\nagain--there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that\nhe knew quite well--there was nearly everything as if he had left\nit but yesterday, and all his recent life had been but a happy\ndream.\n\nBut it was pure, earnest, joyful reality.  They drove straight to\nthe door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at,\nwith awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen\noff in grandeur and size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to\nreceive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when\nthey got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the\nwhole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his\nhead--no, not once; not even when he contradicted a very old\npostboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he knew\nit best, though he had only come that way once, and that time\nfast asleep.  There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms\nready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.\n\nNotwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour\nwas over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had\nmarked their journey down.  Mr. Brownlow did not join them at\ndinner, but remained in a separate room.  The two other gentlemen\nhurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short\nintervals when they were present, conversed apart.  Once, Mrs.\nMaylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an\nhour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping.  All these things\nmade Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous\nand uncomfortable.  They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they\nexchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid\nto hear the sound of their own voices.\n\nAt length, when nine o`clock had come, and they began to think\nthey were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr.\nGrimwig entered the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom\nOliver almost shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it\nwas his brother, and it was the same man he had met at the\nmarket-town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his\nlittle room.  Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he\ncould not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the\ndoor.

{"text":"\n`This is a painful task,` said he, `but these declarations, which\nhave been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in\nsubstance repeated here.  I would have spared you the\ndegradation, but we must hear them from your own lips before we\npart, and you know why.`\n\n`Go on,` said the person addressed, turning away his face.\n`Quick.  I have almost done enough, I think.  Don`t keep me\nhere.`\n\n`This child,` said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and\nlaying his hand upon his head, `is your half-brother; the\nillegitimate son of your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by\npoor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.`\n\n`Yes,` said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy:  the beating of\nwhose heart he might have heard.  `That is the bastard child.`\n\n`The term you use,` said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, `is a reproach to\nthose long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world.\nIt reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it.\nLet that pass.  He was born in this town.`\n\n`In the workhouse of this town,` was the sullen reply. `You have\nthe story there.`  He pointed impatiently to the papers as he\nspoke.\n\n`I must have it here, too,` said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon\nthe listeners.\n\n`Listen then!  You!` returned Monks.  `His father being taken ill\nat Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been\nlong separated, who went from Paris and took me with her--to look\nafter his property, for what I know, for she had no great\naffection for him, nor he for her.  He knew nothing of us, for\nhis senses were gone, and he slumbered on till next day, when he\ndied.  Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on the night\nhis illness first came on, directed to yourself`; he addressed\nhimself to Mr. Brownlow; `and enclosed in a few short lines to\nyou, with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was\nnot to be forwarded till after he was dead.  One of these papers\nwas a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.`\n\n`What of the letter?` asked Mr. Brownlow.\n\n`The letter?--A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a\npenitent confession, and prayers to God to help her.  He had\npalmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery--to be\nexplained one day--prevented his marrying her just then; and so\nshe had gone on, trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too\nfar, and lost what none could ever give her back.  She was, at\nthat time, within a few months of her confinement.  He told her\nall he had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and\nprayed her, if he died, not to curse his memory, or think the\nconsequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young\nchild; for all the guilt was his.  He reminded her of the day he\nhad given her the little locket and the ring with her christian\nname engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped\none day to have bestowed upon her--prayed her yet to keep it, and\nwear it next her heart, as she had done before--and then ran on,\nwildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone\ndistracted.  I believe he had.`\n\n`The will,` said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver`s tears fell fast.\n\nMonks was silent.\n\n`The will,` said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, `was in the same\nspirit as the letter.  He talked of miseries which his wife had\nbrought upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice,\nand premature bad passions of you his only son, who had been\ntrained to hate him; and left you, and your mother, each an\nannuity of eight hundred pounds.  The bulk of his property he\ndivided into two equal portions--one for Agnes Fleming, and the\nother for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come\nof age.  If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money\nunconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in\nhis minority he should never have stained his name with any\npublic act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong.  He did\nthis, he said, to mark his confidence in the other, and his\nconviction--only strengthened by approaching death--that the\nchild would share her gentle heart, and noble nature.  If he were\ndisappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to\nyou:  for then, and not till then, when both children were equal,\nwould he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none\nupon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with\ncoldness and aversion.`\n\n`My mother,` said Monks, in a louder tone, `did what a woman\nshould have done.  She burnt this will.  The letter never reached\nits destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case\nthey ever tried to lie away the blot.  The girl`s father had the\ntruth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate--I\nlove her for it now--could add.  Goaded by shame and dishonour he\nfled with his children into a remote corner of Wales, changing\nhis very name that his friends might never know of his retreat;\nand here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his\nbed.  The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before;\nhe had searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near;\nit was on the night when he returned home, assured that she had\ndestroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old heart\nbroke.`\n\nThere was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the\nthread of the narrative.\n\n`Years after this,` he said, `this man`s--Edward\nLeeford`s--mother came to me.  He had left her, when only\neighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered,\nforged, and fled to London:  where for two years he had\nassociated with the lowest outcasts.  She was sinking under a\npainful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before\nshe died.  Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made.\nThey were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful;\nand he went back with her to France.`\n\n`There she died,` said Monks, `after a lingering illness; and, on\nher death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with\nher unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they\ninvolved--though she need not have left me that, for I had\ninherited it long before.  She would not believe that the girl\nhad destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled with the\nimpression that a male child had been born, and was alive.  I\nswore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never\nto let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most\nunrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply\nfelt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by\ndraggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot.  She was right.\nHe came in my way at last.  I began well; and, but for babbling\ndrabs, I would have finished as I began!`\n\nAs the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered\ncurses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr.\nBrownlow turned to the terrified group beside him, and explained\nthat the Jew, who had been his old accomplice and confidant, had\na large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared:  of which some part\nwas to be given up, in the event of his being rescued:  and that\na dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country\nhouse for the purpose of identifying him.\n\n`The locket and ring?` said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.\n\n`I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole\nthem from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,` answered\nMonks without raising his eyes.  `You know what became of them.`\n\nMr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with\ngreat alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and\ndragging her unwilling consort after him.\n\n`Do my hi`s deceive me!` cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned\nenthusiasm, `or is that little Oliver?  Oh O-li-ver, if you\nknow`d how I`ve been a-grieving for you--`\n\n`Hold your tongue, fool,` murmured Mrs. Bumble.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Isn`t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?` remonstrated the workhouse\nmaster.  `Can`t I be supposed to feel--_I_ as brought him up\nporochially--when I see him a-setting here among ladies and\ngentlemen of the very affablest description!  I always loved that\nboy as if he`d been my--my--my own grandfather,` said Mr. Bumble,\nhalting for an appropriate comparison.  `Master Oliver, my dear,\nyou remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat?  Ah!\nhe went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated handles,\nOliver.`\n\n`Come, sir,` said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; `suppress your feelings.`\n\n`I will do my endeavours, sir,` replied Mr. Bumble.  `How do you\ndo, sir?  I hope you are very well.`\n\nThis salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up\nto within a short distance of the respectable couple.  He\ninquired, as he pointed to Monks,\n\n`Do you know that person?`\n\n`No,` replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.\n\n`Perhaps _you_ don`t?` said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse.\n\n`I never saw him in all my life,` said Mr. Bumble.\n\n`Nor sold him anything, perhaps?`\n\n`No,` replied Mrs. Bumble.\n\n`You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?` said\nMr. Brownlow.\n\n`Certainly not,` replied the matron.  `Why are we brought here to\nanswer to such nonsense as this?`\n\nAgain Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that\ngentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness.  But not\nagain did he return with a stout man and wife; for this time, he\nled in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked.\n\n`You shut the door the night old Sally died,` said the foremost\none, raising her shrivelled hand, `but you couldn`t shut out the\nsound, nor stop the chinks.`\n\n`No, no,` said the other, looking round her and wagging her\ntoothless jaws.  `No, no, no.`\n\n`We heard her try to tell you what she`d done, and saw you take a\npaper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the\npawnbroker`s shop,` said the first.\n\n`Yes,` added the second, `and it was a \"locket and gold ring.\"\nWe found out that, and saw it given you.  We were by.  Oh! we\nwere by.`\n\n`And we know more than that,` resumed the first, `for she told us\noften, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling\nshe should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time\nthat she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of\nthe child.`\n\n`Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?` asked Mr. Grimwig\nwith a motion towards the door.\n\n`No,` replied the woman; `if he--she pointed to Monks--`has been\ncoward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded\nall these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing\nmore to say.  I _did_ sell them, and they`re where you`ll never get\nthem.  What then?`\n\n`Nothing,` replied Mr. Brownlow, `except that it remains for us\nto take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of\ntrust again.  You may leave the room.`\n\n`I hope,` said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great\nruefulness, as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women:\n`I hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not\ndeprive me of my porochial office?`\n\n`Indeed it will,` replied Mr. Brownlow.  `You may make up your\nmind to that, and think yourself well off besides.`\n\n`It was all Mrs. Bumble.  She _would_ do it,` urged Mr. Bumble;\nfirst looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the\nroom.\n\n`That is no excuse,` replied Mr. Brownlow.  `You were present on\nthe occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are\nthe more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law\nsupposes that your wife acts under your direction.`\n\n`If the law supposes that,` said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat\nemphatically in both hands, `the law is a ass--a idiot.  If\nthat`s the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I\nwish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience--by\nexperience.`\n\nLaying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr.\nBumble fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his\npockets, followed his helpmate downstairs.\n"}

{"text":"\n`Young lady,` said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, `give me your\nhand.  Do not tremble.  You need not fear to hear the few\nremaining words we have to say.`\n\n`If they have--I do not know how they can, but if they have--any\nreference to me,` said Rose, `pray let me hear them at some other\ntime.  I have not strength or spirits now.`\n\n`Nay,` returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his;\n`you have more fortitude than this, I am sure.  Do you know this\nyoung lady, sir?`\n\n`Yes,` replied Monks.\n\n`I never saw you before,` said Rose faintly.\n\n`I have seen you often,` returned Monks.\n\n`The father of the unhappy Agnes had _two_ daughters,` said Mr.\nBrownlow.  `What was the fate of the other--the child?`\n\n`The child,` replied Monks, `when her father died in a strange\nplace, in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of\npaper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or\nrelatives could be traced--the child was taken by some wretched\ncottagers, who reared it as their own.`\n\n`Go on,` said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach.\n`Go on!`\n\n`You couldn`t find the spot to which these people had repaired,`\nsaid Monks, `but where friendship fails, hatred will often force\na way.  My mother found it, after a year of cunning search--ay,\nand found the child.`\n\n`She took it, did she?`\n\n`No.  The people were poor and began to sicken--at least the man\ndid--of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving\nthem a small present of money which would not last long, and\npromised more, which she never meant to send.  She didn`t quite\nrely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child`s\nunhappiness, but told the history of the sister`s shame, with\nsuch alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of the\nchild, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was\nillegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other.  The\ncircumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it; and\nthere the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to\nsatisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw\nthe girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home.  There was\nsome cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our\nefforts she remained there and was happy.  I lost sight of her,\ntwo or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months\nback.`\n\n`Do you see her now?`\n\n`Yes.  Leaning on your arm.`\n\n`But not the less my niece,` cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the\nfainting girl in her arms; `not the less my dearest child.  I\nwould not lose her now, for all the treasures of the world.  My\nsweet companion, my own dear girl!`\n\n`The only friend I ever had,` cried Rose, clinging to her. `The\nkindest, best of friends.  My heart will burst.  I cannot bear\nall this.`\n\n`You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and\ngentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she\nknew,` said Mrs. Maylie, embracing her tenderly. `Come, come, my\nlove, remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms,\npoor child!  See here--look, look, my dear!`\n\n`Not aunt,` cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; `I`ll\nnever call her aunt--sister, my own dear sister, that something\ntaught my heart to love so dearly from the first!  Rose, dear,\ndarling Rose!`\n\nLet the tears which fell, and the broken words which were\nexchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans, be\nsacred.  A father, sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in\nthat one moment.  Joy and grief were mingled in the cup; but\nthere were no bitter tears:  for even grief itself arose so\nsoftened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections,\nthat it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain.\n\nThey were a long, long time alone.  A soft tap at the door, at\nlength announced that some one was without.  Oliver opened it,\nglided away, and gave place to Harry Maylie.\n\n`I know it all,` he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl.\n`Dear Rose, I know it all.`\n\n`I am not here by accident,` he added after a lengthened silence;\n`nor have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it\nyesterday--only yesterday.  Do you guess that I have come to\nremind you of a promise?`\n\n`Stay,` said Rose.  `You _do_ know all.`\n"}

{"text":"\n`All.  You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the\nsubject of our last discourse.`\n\n`I did.`\n\n`Not to press you to alter your determination,` pursued the young\nman, `but to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay\nwhatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and\nif you still adhered to your former determination, I pledged\nmyself, by no word or act, to seek to change it.`\n\n`The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me\nnow,` said Rose firmly.  `If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty\nto her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and\nsuffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night?  It\nis a struggle,` said Rose, `but one I am proud to make; it is a\npang, but one my heart shall bear.`\n\n`The disclosure of to-night,`--Harry began.\n\n`The disclosure of to-night,` replied Rose softly, `leaves me in\nthe same position, with reference to you, as that in which I\nstood before.`\n\n`You harden your heart against me, Rose,` urged her lover.\n\n`Oh Harry, Harry,` said the young lady, bursting into tears; `I\nwish I could, and spare myself this pain.`\n\n`Then why inflict it on yourself?` said Harry, taking her hand.\n`Think, dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.`\n\n`And what have I heard!  What have I heard!` cried Rose. `That a\nsense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he\nshunned all--there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said\nenough.`\n\n`Not yet, not yet,` said the young man, detaining her as she\nrose.  `My hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling:  every thought\nin life except my love for you:  have undergone a change.  I\noffer you, now, no distinction among a bustling crowd; no\nmingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the blood\nis called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and\nshame; but a home--a heart and home--yes, dearest Rose, and\nthose, and those alone, are all I have to offer.`\n\n`What do you mean!` she faltered.\n\n`I mean but this--that when I left you last, I left you with a\nfirm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself\nand me; resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would\nmake yours mine; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at\nyou, for I would turn from it.  This I have done.  Those who have\nshrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved\nyou so far right.  Such power and patronage:  such relatives of\ninfluence and rank:  as smiled upon me then, look coldly now; but\nthere are smiling fields and waving trees in England`s richest\ncounty; and by one village church--mine, Rose, my own!--there\nstands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of, than\nall the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold.  This is\nmy rank and station now, and here I lay it down!`\n\n`It`s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,` said Mr.\nGrimwig, waking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over\nhis head.\n\nTruth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable\ntime.  Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in\ntogether), could offer a word in extenuation.\n\n`I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,` said Mr.\nGrimwig, `for I began to think I should get nothing else.  I`ll\ntake the liberty, if you`ll allow me, of saluting the bride that\nis to be.`\n\nMr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon\nthe blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was\nfollowed both by the doctor and Mr. Brownlow:  some people affirm\nthat Harry Maylie had been observed to set it, originally, in a\ndark room adjoining; but the best authorities consider this\ndownright scandal:  he being young and a clergyman.\n\n`Oliver, my child,` said Mrs. Maylie, `where have you been, and\nwhy do you look so sad?  There are tears stealing down your face\nat this moment.  What is the matter?`\n\nIt is a world of disappointment:  often to the hopes we most\ncherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.\n\nPoor Dick was dead!\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER LII\n\nFAGIN`S LAST NIGHT ALIVE\n\nThe court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces.\nInquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From\nthe rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the\nsmallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one\nman--Fagin.  Before him and behind:  above, below, on the right\nand on the left:  he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament,\nall bright with gleaming eyes.\n\nHe stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand\nresting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear,\nand his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater\ndistinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who\nwas delivering his charge to the jury.  At times, he turned his\neyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest\nfeatherweight in his favour; and when the points against him were\nstated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in\nmute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his\nbehalf.  Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not\nhand or foot.  He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and\nnow that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same\nstrained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on him,\nas though he listened still.\n\nA slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself.  Looking\nround, he saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider\ntheir verdict.  As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see\nthe people rising above each other to see his face:  some hastily\napplying their glasses to their eyes:  and others whispering\ntheir neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence.  A few\nthere were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the\njury, in impatient wonder how they could delay.  But in no one\nface--not even among the women, of whom there were many\nthere--could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any\nfeeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be\ncondemned.\n\nAs he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike\nstillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen\nhad turned towards the judge.  Hush!\n\nThey only sought permission to retire.\n\nHe looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they\npassed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant;\nbut that was fruitless.  The jailer touched him on the shoulder.\nHe followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on\na chair.  The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it.\n\nHe looked up into the gallery again.  Some of the people were\neating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the\ncrowded place was very hot.  There was one young man sketching\nhis face in a little note-book.  He wondered whether it was like,\nand looked on when the artist broke his pencil-point, and made\nanother with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done.\n\nIn the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his\nmind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what\nit cost, and how he put it on.  There was an old fat gentleman on\nthe bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and\nnow come back.  He wondered within himself whether this man had\nbeen to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it;\nand pursued this train of careless thought until some new object\ncaught his eye and roused another.\n\nNot that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from\none oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his\nfeet; it was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way,\nand he could not fix his thoughts upon it.  Thus, even while he\ntrembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he\nfell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how\nthe head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend\nit, or leave it as it was.  Then, he thought of all the horrors\nof the gallows and the scaffold--and stopped to watch a man\nsprinkling the floor to cool it--and then went on to think again.\n\nAt length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from\nall towards the door.  The jury returned, and passed him close.\nHe could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have\nbeen of stone.  Perfect stillness ensued--not a rustle--not a\nbreath--Guilty.\n\nThe building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and\nanother, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength\nas they swelled out, like angry thunder.  It was a peal of joy\nfrom the populace outside, greeting the news that he would die on\nMonday.\n\nThe noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say\nwhy sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had\nresumed his listening attitude, and looked intently at his\nquestioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated\nbefore he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he\nwas an old man--an old man--and so, dropping into a whisper, was\nsilent again.\n\nThe judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood\nwith the same air and gesture.  A woman in the gallery, uttered\nsome exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked\nhastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet\nmore attentively.  The address was solemn and impressive; the\nsentence fearful to hear.  But he stood, like a marble figure,\nwithout the motion of a nerve.  His haggard face was still thrust\nforward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out\nbefore him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and\nbeckoned him away.  He gazed stupidly about him for an instant,\nand obeyed.\n\nThey led him through a paved room under the court, where some\nprisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were\ntalking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked\ninto the open yard.  There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but,\nas he passed, the prisoners fell back to render him more visible\nto the people who were clinging to the bars:  and they assailed\nhim with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed.  He shook\nhis fist, and would have spat upon them; but his conductors\nhurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim\nlamps, into the interior of the prison.\n\nHere, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means\nof anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to\none of the condemned cells, and left him there--alone.\n\nHe sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for\nseat and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the\nground, tried to collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to\nremember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said:\nthough it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear\na word.  These gradually fell into their proper places, and by\ndegrees suggested more:  so that in a little time he had the\nwhole, almost as it was delivered.  To be hanged by the neck,\ntill he was dead--that was the end.  To be hanged by the neck\ntill he was dead.\n\nAs it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had\nknown who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his\nmeans.  They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could\nhardly count them.  He had seen some of them die,--and had joked\ntoo, because they died with prayers upon their lips.  With what a\nrattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed,\nfrom strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes!\n"}

{"text":"\nSome of them might have inhabited that very cell--sat upon that\nvery spot.  It was very dark; why didn`t they bring a light?  The\ncell had been built for many years.  Scores of men must have\npassed their last hours there.  It was like sitting in a vault\nstrewn with dead bodies--the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms,\nthe faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous veil.--Light,\nlight!\n\nAt length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy\ndoor and walls, two men appeared:  one bearing a candle, which he\nthrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall:  the\nother dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the\nprisoner was to be left alone no more.\n\nThen came the night--dark, dismal, silent night.  Other watchers\nare glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life\nand coming day.  To him they brought despair.  The boom of every\niron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound--Death.\nWhat availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which\npenetrated even there, to him?  It was another form of knell,\nwith mockery added to the warning.\n\nThe day passed off.  Day?  There was no day; it was gone as soon\nas come--and night came on again; night so long, and yet so\nshort; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting\nhours.  At one time he raved and blasphemed; and at another\nhowled and tore his hair.  Venerable men of his own persuasion\nhad come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with\ncurses.  They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them\noff.\n\nSaturday night.  He had only one night more to live.  And as he\nthought of this, the day broke--Sunday.\n\nIt was not until the night of this last awful day, that a\nwithering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full\nintensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any\ndefined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been\nable to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon.\nHe had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each\nother in their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts,\nmade no effort to rouse his attention.  He had sat there, awake,\nbut dreaming.  Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping\nmouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of\nfear and wrath that even they--used to such sights--recoiled from\nhim with horror.  He grew so terrible, at last, in all the\ntortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to\nsit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.\n\nHe cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He\nhad been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of\nhis capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth.  His\nred hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn,\nand twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his\nunwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up.\nEight--nine--then.  If it was not a trick to frighten him, and\nthose were the real hours treading on each other`s heels, where\nwould he be, when they came round again!  Eleven!  Another\nstruck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to\nvibrate.  At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own\nfuneral train; at eleven--\n\nThose dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery\nand such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too\noften, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so\ndread a spectacle as that.  The few who lingered as they passed,\nand wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged\nto-morrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could\nhave seen him.\n\nFrom early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of\ntwo and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and\ninquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been\nreceived.  These being answered in the negative, communicated the\nwelcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out\nto one another the door from which he must come out, and showed\nwhere the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling\nsteps away, turned back to conjure up the scene.  By degrees they\nfell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the\nstreet was left to solitude and darkness.\n\nThe space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong\nbarriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road\nto break the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow\nand Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of\nadmission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs.  They\nwere immediately admitted into the lodge.\n\n`Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?` said the man whose\nduty it was to conduct them.  `It`s not a sight for children,\nsir.`\n\n`It is not indeed, my friend,` rejoined Mr. Brownlow; `but my\nbusiness with this man is intimately connected with him; and as\nthis child has seen him in the full career of his success and\nvillainy, I think it as well--even at the cost of some pain and\nfear--that he should see him now.`\n\nThese few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to\nOliver.  The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with\nsome curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which\nthey had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways,\ntowards the cells.\n"}

{"text":"\n`This,` said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple\nof workmen were making some preparations in profound\nsilence--`this is the place he passes through.  If you step this\nway, you can see the door he goes out at.`\n\nHe led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for\ndressing the prison food, and pointed to a door.  There was an\nopen grating above it, through which came the sound of men`s\nvoices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing\ndown of boards.  There were putting up the scaffold.\n\nFrom this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened\nby other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an\nopen yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a\npassage with a row of strong doors on the left hand.  Motioning\nthem to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of\nthese with his bunch of keys. The two attendants, after a little\nwhispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as\nif glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to\nfollow the jailer into the cell.  They did so.\n\nThe condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself\nfrom side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared\nbeast than the face of a man.  His mind was evidently wandering\nto his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing\nconscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his\nvision.\n\n`Good boy, Charley--well done--` he mumbled.  `Oliver, too, ha!\nha! ha!  Oliver too--quite the gentleman now--quite the--take\nthat boy away to bed!`\n\nThe jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering\nhim not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.\n\n`Take him away to bed!` cried Fagin.  `Do you hear me, some of\nyou?  He has been the--the--somehow the cause of all this.  It`s\nworth the money to bring him up to it--Bolter`s throat, Bill;\nnever mind the girl--Bolter`s throat as deep as you can cut.  Saw\nhis head off!`\n\n`Fagin,` said the jailer.\n\n`That`s me!` cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude\nof listening he had assumed upon his trial.  `An old man, my\nLord; a very old, old man!`\n\n`Here,` said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep\nhim down.  `Here`s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some\nquestions, I suppose.  Fagin, Fagin!  Are you a man?`\n\n`I shan`t be one long,` he replied, looking up with a face\nretaining no human expression but rage and terror.  `Strike them\nall dead!  What right have they to butcher me?`\n\nAs he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking\nto the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they\nwanted there.\n\n`Steady,` said the turnkey, still holding him down.  `Now, sir,\ntell him what you want.  Quick, if you please, for he grows worse\nas the time gets on.`\n\n`You have some papers,` said Mr. Brownlow advancing, `which were\nplaced in your hands, for better security, by a man called\nMonks.`\n\n`It`s all a lie together,` replied Fagin.  `I haven`t one--not\none.`\n\n`For the love of God,` said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, `do not say\nthat now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they\nare.  You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that\nthere is no hope of any further gain.  Where are those papers?`\n\n`Oliver,` cried Fagin, beckoning to him.  `Here, here! Let me\nwhisper to you.`\n\n`I am not afraid,` said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished\nMr. Brownlow`s hand.\n"}

{"text":"\n`The papers,` said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, `are in a\ncanvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top\nfront-room.  I want to talk to you, my dear.  I want to talk to\nyou.`\n\n`Yes, yes,` returned Oliver.  `Let me say a prayer.  Do!  Let me\nsay one prayer.  Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we\nwill talk till morning.`\n\n`Outside, outside,` replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him\ntowards the door, and looking vacantly over his head. `Say I`ve\ngone to sleep--they`ll believe you.  You can get me out, if you\ntake me so.  Now then, now then!`\n\n`Oh!  God forgive this wretched man!` cried the boy with a burst\nof tears.\n\n`That`s right, that`s right,` said Fagin.  `That`ll help us on.\nThis door first.  If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows,\ndon`t you mind, but hurry on.  Now, now, now!`\n\n`Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?` inquired the turnkey.\n\n`No other question,` replied Mr. Brownlow.  `If I hoped we could\nrecall him to a sense of his position--`\n\n`Nothing will do that, sir,` replied the man, shaking his head.\n`You had better leave him.`\n\nThe door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.\n\n`Press on, press on,` cried Fagin.  `Softly, but not so slow.\nFaster, faster!`\n\nThe men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his\ngrasp, held him back.  He struggled with the power of\ndesperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that\npenetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until\nthey reached the open yard.\n\nIt was some time before they left the prison.  Oliver nearly\nswooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an\nhour or more, he had not the strength to walk.\n\nDay was dawning when they again emerged.  A great multitude had\nalready assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking\nand playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing,\nquarrelling, joking.  Everything told of life and animation, but\none dark cluster of objects in the centre of all--the black stage,\nthe cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death.\n\n"}

{"text":"\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nAND LAST\n\nThe fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly\nclosed.  The little that remains to their historian to relate, is\ntold in few and simple words.\n\nBefore three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie\nwere married in the village church which was henceforth to be the\nscene of the young clergyman`s labours; on the same day they\nentered into possession of their new and happy home.\n\nMrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law,\nto enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest\nfelicity that age and worth can know--the contemplation of the\nhappiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest\ncares of a well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed.\n\nIt appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck\nof property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never\nprospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were\nequally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to\neach, little more than three thousand pounds.  By the provisions\nof his father`s will, Oliver would have been entitled to the\nwhole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of\nthe opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an\nhonest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his\nyoung charge joyfully acceded.\n\nMonks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion\nto a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly\nsquandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after\nundergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and\nknavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and\ndied in prison.  As far from home, died the chief remaining\nmembers of his friend Fagin`s gang.\n\nMr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son.  Removing with him and\nthe old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house,\nwhere his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining\nwish of Oliver`s warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together\na little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of\nperfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world.\n\nSoon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor\nreturned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old\nfriends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had\nadmitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish\nif he had known how.  For two or three months, he contented\nhimself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree\nwith him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to\nhim, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant,\ntook a bachelor`s cottage outside the village of which his young\nfriend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered.  Here he took\nto gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other\npursuits of a similar kind:  all undertaken with his\ncharacteristic impetuosity.  In each and all he has since become\nfamous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority.\n\nBefore his removal, he had managed to contract a strong\nfriendship for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman\ncordially reciprocated.  He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig\na great many times in the course of the year.  On all such\noccasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great\nardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented\nmanner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration,\nthat his mode is the right one.  On Sundays, he never fails to\ncriticise the sermon to the young clergyman`s face:  always\ninforming Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he\nconsiders it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not\nto say so.  It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr.\nBrownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and\nto remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch\nbetween them, waiting his return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that\nhe was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that\nOliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a\nlaugh on his side, and increases his good humour.\n\nMr. Noah Claypole:  receiving a free pardon from the Crown in\nconsequence of being admitted approver against Fagin:  and\nconsidering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he\ncould wish:  was, for some little time, at a loss for the means\nof a livelihood, not burdened with too much work.  After some\nconsideration, he went into business as an Informer, in which\ncalling he realises a genteel subsistence.  His plan is, to walk\nout once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in\nrespectable attire.  The lady faints away at the doors of\ncharitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with\nthree-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information\nnext day, and pockets half the penalty.  Sometimes Mr. Claypole\nfaints himself, but the result is the same.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually\nreduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers\nin that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over\nothers.  Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse\nand degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being\nseparated from his wife.\n\nAs to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old\nposts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite\ngrey.  They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions\nso equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and\nMr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able\nto discover to which establishment they properly belong.\n"}

{"text":"\nMaster Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes`s crime, fell into a\ntrain of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all,\nthe best.  Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he\nturned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it\nin some new sphere of action.  He struggled hard, and suffered\nmuch, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a\ngood purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer`s\ndrudge, and a carrier`s lad, he is now the merriest young grazier\nin all Northamptonshire.\n\nAnd now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it\napproaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a\nlittle longer space, the thread of these adventures.\n\nI would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so\nlong moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict\nit.  I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early\nwomanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle\nlight, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into\ntheir hearts.  I would paint her the life and joy of the\nfire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her\nthrough the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her\nsweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all\nher goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring\ndischarge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her\ndead sister`s child happy in their love for one another, and\npassing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they\nhad so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those\njoyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to\ntheir merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear\nlaugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the\nsoft blue eye.  These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns\nof thought and speech--I would fain recall them every one.\n\nHow Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of\nhis adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached\nto him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed\nthe thriving seeds of all he wished him to become--how he traced\nin him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own\nbosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and\nsoothing--how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its\nlessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks\nto Him who had protected and preserved them--these are all\nmatters which need not to be told.  I have said that they were\ntruly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart,\nand gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great\nattribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness\ncan never be attained.\n\nWithin the altar of the old village church there stands a white\nmarble tablet, which bears as yet but one word:  `AGNES.`  There\nis no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before\nanother name is placed above it!  But, if the spirits of the Dead\never come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love--the\nlove beyond the grave--of those whom they knew in life, I believe\nthat the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook.\nI believe it none the less because that nook is in a Church, and\nshe was weak and erring.\n"}
